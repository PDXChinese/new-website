Chinese professionals working in downtown Portland gathered for various social activities.  In 1992, they realized that more and more Chinese professionals had moved into the Portland metropolitan area but there was no Chinese organization to provide them with local information and a forum to address their concerns and needs, especially those who had just moved to Portland, Oregon.  After several informal discussions and meetings, they finally decided to plan a few activities to test whether their objectives were of use.

They informally elected Grant Bow of U.S. Bank as the leader of the group.  The initial success of the group's activities, such as a real estate seminar, a tax return seminar, an immigration seminar and a Chinese New Year's gathering, convinced the group that there was a real need for their organization.  They entrusted Rongwei Cai of Tonkon Torp to incorporate the CFAP as a non-profit organization with the State of Oregon on June 11, 1993.

The first Board of Directors of the CFAP consisted of the following people: Grant Bow of U.S. Bank, Rongwei Cai of Tonkon Torp, Fu Li of PSU, Jinke Li of PSU, James Mei of Black Helterline, May Daily of Mutual of New York and David Yu of Schmitt Forge. They represented many professions, such as professors, engineers, bankers, insurance brokers, and lawyers.  These individuals volunteered their time to organize various activities to achieve CFAP's objective of "networking, service and the exchange of information."Based on the needs of its members, the CFAP has conducted a wide range of activities to provide members with opportunities to be acquainted with each other and exchange information.  These activities include seminars on financial investment, insurance, purchasing a house, preparing a tax return, summer picnics, dances/parties, Chinese movies, Chinese New Year's Celebrations, and receptions for delegations from China.

Over the years, the number of regular members of the CFAP has grown steadily.  Computer engineers or specialists were among the fastest growing groups.  In 1997, the Board decided to increase the number of Board members representing the high-tech industry in Oregon.  Thus, Mr. Shaofeng Yu of Intel, Gang Li of Intel, Genghong Ruan of Analogy, Inc., Yueheng Xue of Intel, Songyu He of ABC Technologies, Inc., as well as Mr. Jon Duan of Intel were elected to the Board to serve CFAP.  Today, the total number of members on the CFAP Mailing Directory is about 600.  The Board of Directors serve on a volunteer basis and have changed over the years.  The current Board of Directors for 2002-2003 are: Yuzhong Lin, Li Wei, Zifen Qian, Qigang Yang, Ming Xie, Hua Zhang, Youqing Ma, and Jian Wang.

The leadership of several individuals made it possible for the CFAP to grow and succeed.  The past presidents of the CFAP deserve full recognition.  They are: Grant Bow, James Mei, Rongwei Cai, David Yu, Shaofeng Yu, Ken Ruan,  Liying Zheng, Changhua Wang, and Yuzhong Lin, Zifen Qian, Hardy Li, Victoria Yu, Lin Luo, Iris Zhao, Mike Zhang, John Lin and Weiqiang Yang.

With tremendous support from its members and efforts by its Board Members, CFAP continues to prosper in the Portland area.  We warmly invite you to participate in our organized events and volunteer your time for more interesting and colorful activities to enrich our life in this community.  CFAP welcomes you to join and believes that you can make a difference!
