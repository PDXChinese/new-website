## Vision

Let's Peer Up (LPU) is for neurodiverse children with social communication challenges to learn important social skills and feel confident around others, while neurotypical children gain a greater understanding of people with minds different from theirs.

## Mission

Let's Peer Up (LPU) was founded to facilitate socializing and bonding between neurotypical and neurodiverse children, promote greater awareness of neurodiversity, and advocate for the needs of neurodiverse children. The organization supports members to form school or neighborhood clubs. Members form neurotypical/neurodiverse pairs and enjoy time together in fun activities. This helps people to understand those with different minds, and to prepare them for their future social lives.
