## Our Mission


Project Lotus destigmatizes mental health in Asian-American communities by tackling the model minority stereotype through culturally-relevant education for the community and the empowerment of voices.

Project Lotus advances the movement for Asian Americans to be able to discuss, care for, and advocate mental health freely, without shame or stigma.
