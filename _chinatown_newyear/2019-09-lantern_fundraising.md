## Red Lantern Story, Our Story

A century ago, Portland had the second largest Chinese population next to San Francisco. It once counted for 10% of population in Portland. Chinatown has been not only one of the prominent landmarks but a legacy for this city. Chinatown had its up and down in the past, but never lost its hope. The Chinese community has pledged to work together to help revitalize Chinatown, to make it great again.

In ancient China, lanterns were used to provide light and eventually as aspects of Buddhist worship. Today, they are used for decoration and is a modern form of celebration for the Chinese New Year. From 2018, Chinese community bought 50 red lanterns and hung them on the lampposts during the Chinese New Year. It began from the Chinatown Gate, went along NW 4th Avenue, NW Davis Street and then NW 3rd Avenue, and eventually ended at the entrance of [Lan Su Chinese Garden](https://lansugarden.org/). Under the Portland blue sky, those lanterns truly created a spectacular scene in Chinatown.

The sun was brutal to the materials on those lanterns. The color started to fade after two years. We wish to purchase new lanterns to replace those and to purchase even more, if there are enough donations, so that we can work with City of Portland and Oldtown/Chinatown Community Association to have lanterns on more lampposts starting from 2020 Chinese New Year.
