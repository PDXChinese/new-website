Early 2016, local Chinese community got together in response to the selective prosecution on NYPD Officer Peter Liang. After the rally on Feb 20, we all felt we needed to continue to stay together, no matter which part of town we lived and what the background and profession we had. One thing we realized was we all were Chinese Americans and we needed to collaborate with other majority communities, to voice our concerns to the elected officials, and to better preserve our culture and heritage, as one community.

We all noticed the downhill of Chinatown in recent years. Not long time ago, Chinatown was the place people would go to experience Chinese culture. We understood how it came to this point and why properties were being put on market one after another. We wanted to help. To start,  we have organized a series of Portland Chinatown Saturday Performance on Davis Festival Street. We received overwhelming support from all Chinese performing groups as well as ones from other communities. All the performances were very successful.

At meantime, we knew we would need some level of Chinese ownership of the properties in order to be able to get involved in community activities including land use, architecture design and zoning change. With the booming real estate market, the property price was all time high. But with the environment in the area, it was almost impossible to find an individual Chinese investor to take over the properties which typically had delayed maintenance issue.

That is why we came out of the idea to form a buying group which consisted of a dozen of Chinese community members. We pulled the money together to buy the properties from those Chinese owners like May and Shig Oka couple. We believed such group buying not only made purchase more feasible financially but also had another great advantage, that is, rental income might not be the sole or the highest priority. We would focus more on the benefit of the community and culture and heritage of Chinese Americans.
