受邀参加俄勒冈大学香港学生协会（HKSA）主办的活动，OCC木兰鼓队昨天前往尤金市表演，为他们的香港之夜文化秀增添了色彩。这是一次劳累但极为值得的旅程。

*你们绝对是一个令人惊叹的开场表演。我们喜爱你们的表演，并对你们的辛勤工作和奉献精神表示钦佩。能够认识你们和团队中所有可爱的表演者真是太好了。非常感谢你们抽出时间在星期天和我们一起度过。我们感谢所有成员为呈现这个节目所付出的努力，也感谢你们远道而来的旅程。HKSA很幸运能在我们的节目中邀请到你们，我们真诚地希望未来能再次与你们合作。*

Invited by the University of Oregon's Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA), the OCC Mulan Drum Team traveled to Eugene yesterday to perform in their Hong Kong Night Culture Show. It was an exhausting but incredibly rewarding trip.

Here is the message from the organizer: "You guys were absolutely a stunning show opener. We loved your performance and admire the hard work and dedication. It was very nice to meet you and all the lovely performers on the team. Thank you so much for spending your Sunday with us. We appreciate all of your members’ efforts to put this piece together and for making the journey to Eugene. HKSA is lucky to have you in our show and we sincerely hope to have you back in the future."
