昨天的活动中发生了一件让我们深感温馨的事件。一位母亲不慎丢失了她的包，包内有手机、车钥匙，最重要的是她向表弟借来的600美元现金，用于支付房租。丢失了所有这些让她感到绝望，我们在整个过程中都与她同在。我们的一位志愿者不知疲倦地拨打她的手机，最终与一个无意中将她的包当作捐赠品拿走的人取得联系。母亲通过自己的女儿与持有包的女士交谈的感人时刻让每个人都热泪盈眶。OCC向母亲保证，我们将送给她一张礼品卡，以补偿她所经历的一切，同时也给那位归还包裹的女士一张礼品卡，以示感谢。

A heartwarming incident occurred during yesterday's event that touched us deeply. A mother had misplaced her bag, which contained her phone, car keys, and most importantly, $600 in cash that she had borrowed from her cousin to pay her rent. She was in a state of desperation, and our hearts went out to her throughout the entire ordeal. One of our volunteers tirelessly called her phone until finally getting through to someone who had accidentally picked up her bag as a donation item. The emotional moment of the daughter speaking with the lady in possession of the bag brought tears to everyone's eyes. OCC assured the mother that we would send her a gift card to compensate for what she had gone through, as well as one for the lady who returned the bag with everything intact.
