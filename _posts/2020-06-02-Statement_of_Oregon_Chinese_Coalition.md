As Chinese Americans are fighting discrimination and xenophobia from the coronavirus, Mr. George Floyd was senselessly murdered by a policeman. We stand next to the African American community to strongly condemn racism and violence against black people or any people of color. Such systemic discrimination needs to be stopped.

The protests are erupting from all parts of the country. We wish the beating of their hearts, echoed with their voices, can be heard. We should all show solidarity and join the movement with a sense of responsibility.

Everyone should have the right to live, to be free, and to feel safe. Violent acts rooted in discrimination trample on these rights and violate the fundamental principle of human equality. Recent events are bringing to light the extent of the damages being done to our society because of these injustices. In seeing and hearing the truth, we will make meaningful and constructive changes that lead to a more just society where we can move forward as one people.
