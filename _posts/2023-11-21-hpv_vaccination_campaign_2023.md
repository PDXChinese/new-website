疫情后我们对社区公共卫生健康更加的重视，三月份的健康博览会取得了巨大的成功，明年三月份我们会再聚首。两次大会之间我们会针对与华人有特殊关联的癌症展开宣传工作，这个季度目标选定HPV病毒。因为文化的原因，我们谈论HPV很少，本来是一个奇迹的HPV疫苗，也没有得到应有的重视。在全国范围内，华人接种比例比主流社会低20%。相信在社区内，接种比例也会非常的不平衡。所以，我们希望通过这个问卷调查增加每一个家庭对HPV病毒的了解和唤起对接种HPV疫苗的重视。

问卷只有18个问题，全中文，都是多项选择，花费时间只需3-5分钟。我们希望社区家中有9-26岁孩子(包括女孩和男孩)的家庭都能填写一份。这样的活动在一个社区范围应该是罕见的，为此，我们还邀请Ashley小朋友帮助设计了宣传标志，希望能让这个活动做到家喻户晓。我们会尽快整理问卷结果，把社区现状及时分享给大家，并会积极与各级政府和科研机构沟通，期待能获得更多的社会资源。

问卷链接：[https://forms.gle/39F1LYK2ZCJFvosB6](https://forms.gle/39F1LYK2ZCJFvosB6)，请在全州范围内帮助广泛传播。

如果微信群每一个有适龄儿童的家庭都能填写一份，我们收集到的就不再是样本，呈现出来的将会是社区的全貌。

### Communitywide Survey on HPV and HPV Vaccination
​​
After the pandemic, we continued to focus on public health at community level. The health fair in March was a tremendous success, and we look forward to gathering again next March. Between these two events, we will conduct promotional activities focusing on cancers that are particularly relevant to the Chinese American community. This quarter, the target is the HPV virus. Due to cultural reasons, we seldom discuss HPV, and the miraculous HPV vaccine hasn't received the attention it deserves. Nationally, the vaccination rate among Chinese people is 20% lower than the mainstream society. We believe the vaccination rate in the community is also highly imbalanced. Therefore, through this survey, we aim to increase every family's understanding of the HPV virus and raise awareness of the importance of getting vaccinated.

The survey consists of only 18 questions, all in Chinese, and they are all multiple-choice questions. It will take only 3-5 minutes of your time. We hope every family with children aged 9-26 (including girls and boys) in the community can fill out the survey. Such an activity is rare at community level, and to make it widely known, we have invited Ashley, middle school student, to help design the promotional logo.
