Hi! I'm Danny, and I am a pre-med sophomore studying global health, international relations, and natural science at USC. I am particularly interested in studying the intersection of policy and health, which has led to a newfound passion of addressing health inequities among the Asian-American/Pacific Islander community. In my spare time, I play club tennis, run a guitar account on TikTok, and love to discover and talk about music.

As an executive board member of USC's Chinese American Student Association (CASA), I've been able to be a part of CASA's 姐/哥 "older sibling" mentorship program, where I have mentored incoming USC freshmen and helped them transition to college life in the unique environment of an online semester. From SAT tutoring to camp counseling to college counseling, I have had so many amazing opportunities to work with students in different capacities.

I know from first-hand experience that friends and fellow peers are some of the best resources to turn to for compassion, understanding, and support. Growing up with a dichotomous identity, facing the expectations of the "model minority", and being an Asian-American during COVID all present so many unique challenges. The good news is that nobody has to go through any of it alone, so please feel free to reach out! :)
