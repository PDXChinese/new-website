Laura is a senior at Scripps College majoring in Economics. She is passionate about environmental economics and hopes to pursue a career in sustainable finance in the future. Laura enjoys photography, playing guitar, spending time with family and friends, and traveling the world.

I am a current tutor for the mathematics department at Scripps College and have had extensive experience mentoring students from middle school to college through academics. Additionally, I have had experience working during orientation for incoming first years at Scripps and have had the opportunity to mentor these students during their transition into college life. Both of these opportunities have been extremely rewarding and allowed me to connect with many students and peers in different capacities.

From personal experience I have greatly benefited from mentors throughout high school and college and really recognize the importance of talking through any issues or stress that can come up in daily life. There are many unique challenges that come with being Asian American, and as a half Asian myself, I have also experienced those challenges. It is important to know that whatever challenges you are facing, you do not have to face them alone. Please feel free to reach out to me at any point and I would be happy to talk :)
