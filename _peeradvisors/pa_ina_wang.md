Ina is a senior at the University of Southern California studying Neuroscience. She will be attending UC Berkeley's School of Optometry next fall, with plans to specialize in neuro-optometric brain injury rehabilitation. At USC, she is involved in molecular biology research, breakdancing/urban dance, and a variety of community service activities. In her free time, she loves to practice yoga, go thrifting, explore new food places, watch Netflix, and make way too many Spotify playlists. Ina has years of previous experience with academic tutoring and being a mentor for students of all ages. She understands the personal difficulties of growing up in a community where mental health is stigmatized, so she hopes to be a guiding and empathetic ear for anyone who needs it.
