Her biggest motivator for pursuing a path in public interest work is the ability to work directly with marginalized communities and help develop solutions that are in their best interest.

Alisha has over a decade of experience advising and mentoring peers in various capacities, and she looks forward to providing an empathetic ear and creating meaningful connections with peers in her hometown community. Some topics she has experience advising on include managing stress, strengthening communication, finding balance, resolving conflict, and developing a bicultural sense of self.
