## Mission

Chinese Faith Baptist Church (CFBC) was organized in June 1989, to serve the spiritual needs of the English and Cantonese population in the Portland metro area.

The church first met at the basement of a founding member in north Portland. A month later, Evangel Baptist Church was willing to be the host and implement the vision of having two churches in one building. The relationship between the two churches has been pleasant and God-honoring.

CFBC was welcomed into the fellowship of the CBNorthwest in March 1990. Worship services were conducted in English with consecutive (line-by-line) Cantonese interpretation. In the following years the church adopted the mission of disciple-making, defined its values, refined its structure and reached out to the community and beyond through various ministry programs and events. Fellowship groups and small groups were launched to meet the needs of increased attendance. In 2009, we moved into our current location in Lake Oswego.
