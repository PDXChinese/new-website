The Portland Chinese Festival is back!  
As Oregon reopens, we are returning to Pioneer Courthouse Square this year to once again celebrate culture and community just like we did in 2019.  
We will be bringing back the spectacular performances, delicious Chinese food, music and arts from local artists and more.  
Get ready for a full day of programming suitable for all ages!
