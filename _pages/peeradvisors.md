The **purpose** of the Peer Advisory Program is to work towards de-stigmatizing mental health and giving Chinese American youth a safe and confidential opportunity to seek support from Peer Advisors. It is important to note that our Peer Advisors are nonclinical, so they are not able to fill the gap of mental health professionals and treatment. However, they are available to provide encouragement and resources to help peers create goals and navigate stressful situations and experiences, and they are also available to simply provide an empathetic ear. Peer-supported mental health care has been shown to improve mental and physical health among youth, and the OHA grant makes this important effort possible.

### More Background

According to the National Latino and Asian American Study, Asian Americans have a 17.3% lifetime rate of mental illness, yet Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health treatment than Whites. Youth with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable, because they often experience overwhelming barriers, such as stigma and shame. In fact, in 2017, suicide was the leading cause of death for Asian Americans ages 15 to 24. Youth mental and behavioral health among the Chinese American community is a serious problem, and it has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The time to address mental health within the Chinese American community is long overdue, which is why we seek to make our Peer Advisory Program a priority within our work.

There are many causes for the development of mental illnesses, but the parental pressure to succeed in academics continues to be a leading cause for mental illness among Chinese American youth. The harmful "model minority" stereotype creates additional pressure on Chinese American youth to succeed both within and outside of school. Other causes include:

•	Difficulty in balancing two different cultures and developing a bicultural sense of self  
•	Family obligations based on strong traditional and cultural values  
•	Racial or cultural discrimination  

Mental health stigma continues to persist in Chinese culture, particularly among parents and elders. As a result, Chinese American youth tend to dismiss or deny mental health symptoms, preventing them from seeking help from trusted adults and mental health professionals.
