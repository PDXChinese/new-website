Peer support can be an important tool in helping children and youth overcome personal challenges they are facing at school or at home. Our Peer Advisors are available to provide encouragement and resources to help their peers create goals and navigate stressful situations and experiences, and they are also available to simply provide an empathetic ear.

All meetings are offered free of charge. OCC and our Peer Advisors are committed to confidentiality unless the participating youth or others may be harmed significantly if the information is not disclosed.
