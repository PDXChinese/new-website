Youth mental and behavioral health in Chinese American community is more serious than the numbers can show. Part of the reason is related to its culture, which makes people feel losing face if other people know about it. Another reason is lack of education. Very often, typical symptoms to the professionals are being interpreted in other ways by the parents. Most of the issues are kept in the families until some of them show up in headlines news. Pandemic makes things definitely worse by making so many mental and behavioral health issues become the major concerns by parents. It is no better time to address this issue. OHA grant makes this ambitious effort possible.
