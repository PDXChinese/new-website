# To explore, promote, and take pride in chinese culture through dance

We’re looking for a maximum of 15 dancers, but preferably add around 3 more dancers for the August 6th performance. Previous dance experience is not necessary but extremely helpful.

We will practice every weekend on Saturdays/Sundays starting June 9th until August 6th from 4-6 PM plus one rehearsal the night before the performance. Afterwards we plan to continue dancing for fun once a week on Sundays. We were thinking of doing 2 large group dance performances and 1 small group dance on August 6th.

### Practice place is to be determined, most likely along highway 26 and I-217 for convenient commuting.
