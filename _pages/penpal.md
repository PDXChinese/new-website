# Pen Pal Project for Multiracial Youth Groups

### Background

Pen Pal is an old-fashioned way of person-to-person communication. At internet age, it still has its place as short phrases and acronyms in social media tend to leave much less time for people to think. With our communities and nation being plagued with hatred and violence, it is critical for us to create a space for people to get connected and open up. By sharing our lives and welcoming others in, people will see the similarities outweigh the differences. This will not only help protect against violence and adversity with more discovery and acceptance as well as understanding and kindness, but also help addressing the racially motivated hatred through cross-cultural connections. This applies to every age group but starting with youth will have a long-lasting impact.
