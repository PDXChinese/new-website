在新冠病毒传播速度逐渐加快之际，州政府决定动员社区组织（CBO），希望通过社区的力量做到宣传与服务无死角。借助全社区公益活动积累下来影响力，OCC的申请已经得到批准，在年底前将得到近八万美元资金，为Metro三个县的华人提供防疫宣传教育和对需要隔离低收入个人和家庭提供帮助。为此，OCC已经成立了Task Force，并正在积极搭建框架，包括电话专线，专职人员的聘用等。所有信息将会OCC网站上 ([http://pdxchinese.org/coronavirus/](http://pdxchinese.org/coronavirus/))持续公布更新。

我们现在讨论最多的是如何利用这个项目为失去各种活动的学生们提供一个社会实践机会，因而决定设立COVID-19 Community Response Internship，向16周岁以上的高年级高中生和在校大学生开放。暂时提供10个名额，根据情况会持续扩招。录取的学生将获得一次性500美元的stipend，活动有关的花销会得到全额报销。因为希望实习生们能够一同参加下个星期OHA的培训，我们的录取会采取rolling admissions方式。请尽快填写[报名表格](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkQbyH2lc3voR0aCBaZae0ZcndOnwwR5iFYxThN3jxoJNJ6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)。
