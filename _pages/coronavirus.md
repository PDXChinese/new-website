### [Locals for Locals](https://www.locals-for-locals.com/)

'My name is Philippe and I'm currently a junior at Oregon Episcopal School. I've started Locals for Locals, a nonprofit organization, in hopes of helping local businesses during the Coronavirus outbreak, while also helping the local community heal and grow.'

'We're are currently donating all proceeds to Clay Street Table, a wonderful place that I have been volunteering.'

### [Letter For Gratitude](https://www.lettersforgratitude.org/)

'Letters for Gratitude started out of a desire to help those in need during a time of global lockdown and self-isolation. Our mission is to thank those on the front lines fighting the COVID-19 pandemic who have been providing services and medical help for those affected by COVID-19. While we are unable to thank workers in person, Letters for Gratitude is dedicated to helping our community show appreciation for those that risk their lives every day through hand-written cards.'

'What We Do: Our organization offers private tutoring in multiple subjects of various levels for free. We can teach students ranging from kindergarten all the way up to 9th grade. The teachers are all student volunteers who have first hand experience and expertise in the subjects they teach. Lessons are 30 - 60 minutes long (depends on subject and difficulty). Lessons will be taught using the Zoom app. We are a non-profit free of charge organization. Our program depends on student and teacher cooperation.'
