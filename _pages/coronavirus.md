### [Letter For Gratitude](https://www.lettersforgratitude.org/)

'Letters for Gratitude started out of a desire to help those in need during a time of global lockdown and self-isolation. Our mission is to thank those on the front lines fighting the COVID-19 pandemic who have been providing services and medical help for those affected by COVID-19. While we are unable to thank workers in person, Letters for Gratitude is dedicated to helping our community show appreciation for those that risk their lives every day through hand-written cards.'

The answer we give is to organize Weekly Talk on the Zoom platform.'

Lessons will be taught using the Zoom app. We are a non-profit free of charge organization. Our program depends on student and teacher cooperation.'

'In order to better fight the epidemic, our responsibility is to stay at home. To make life as colorful as the color of spring in the outdoor, why don't we engage in a Cloud Talent Show, whether it is an adult or a child, you can come up with what you are good at. It can be singing, dancing, opera, musical instruments, cooking, crafts, gardens, and even poetry and wine tasting. While entertaining yourself, spread the full of positive energy ...'
