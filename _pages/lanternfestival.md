# Harvest Moon Festival 2021  

The Harvest Moon Festival, also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival, Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival, is a traditional festival celebrated by many East and Southeast Asian communities. Lanterns of all size and shapes, are carried and displayed â€“ symbolic beacons that light people's path to prosperity and good fortune. Mooncakes, a rich pastry typically filled with sweet-bean, yolk , meat or lotus-seed paste, are traditionally eaten during this festival.

While historically the festival was a time to enjoy the successful reaping of rice and wheat with food offerings made in honor of the moon, today, it is an occasion for outdoor reunions among friends and relatives to eat mooncakes and watch the moon, a symbol of harmony and unity.

A few community organizations in Old Town/Chinatown had been collaboratively planning a big celebration but had to cancel due to the pandemic. Instead CCBA and OCC will jointly organize some smaller scale activities on September 18, including moon cake distribution, lion dancing, drum performance, CPOP dancing, [calligraphy and photography exhibit](https://pdxchinese.org/artexhibit/), and exhibit on history of Chinese railroad workers, etc.
