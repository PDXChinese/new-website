### Tie Li

Tie Li was born in Beijing, China during the Cultural Revolution. The mainstream art at that time were heavily influenced by soviet Russia’s social realism. As a young artist, he was attracted by the freedom of artistic expression that filtered in from outside of China during the 1980s, he was deeply affected by the rebellion art movement known in China as "the stars", whose works can be characterized with strong individual styles and socio-political criticism of that time. Tie immigrated to the US in 1987. and earned his MFA degree from the School of Art + Design at San Diego State University in 1997, with a focus in painting and photography.  His immigrant experience in America led him to look closely at the issues of cultural identity in art. His artworks are telling stories of immigrants in general, their nostalgia, forbearance, struggle in life, and resistance to simulation.

### Limei Lai

Limei Lai is a Portland-based artist and Chinese tutor who enjoys working with oil, acrylic, fabric and embroidery. The use of fabric and thread connects to an embroidery artist, her mother. Her wood works are inspired by her hometown, where wood carvings can be seen in houses and temples. The handling of fabric and embroidery incorporated into her acrylic paintings is distinctive.

Limei tells generational stories. Her themes depict the fear of change, weakness and aging. She often uses both animal and botanical figures to demonstrate that humans are not separate from nature, but are nature. Her roots as Chinese with her current experience as an American immigrant are combined in her art. Her message to the public is that facing fears and accepting vulnerability can build positive strength. She emphasizes the beauty of ageing faces,
showing death as a natural part of human experience. Limei believes that art not only evokes issues and problems in society, it celebrates the beauty of this world in its entirety too.

Currently Limei is working towards gaining her Bachelor’s degree in Fine Art. She is the featured mural artist in the 2020 Fresh Paint mural project. Her works were shown in Local 14 art show, Red E Cafe Gallery, and the Paragon Gallery art show. She states, “Art is to celebrate life and to seal the moments that make us smile with tears.”
