OCC is so grateful to Oregon Health Authority (OHA) with a very generous grant to tackle mental and behavioral health crisis under pandemic in Chinese American community. We will use the grant to make a big push in the community to look into mental health issues and come out with solutions that can last beyond grant period.

### Peer Advisors

Peer support can be an important tool in helping children and youth overcome personal challenges they are facing at school or at home. Our Peer Advisors are available to provide encouragement and resources to help their peers create goals and navigate stressful situations and experiences, and they are also available to simply provide an empathetic ear.

All meetings are offered free of charge. It is important to note that our advising program is nonclinical, so our Peer Advisors are not able to fill the gap of mental health professionals and treatment. OCC and our Peer Advisors are committed to confidentiality unless the participating youth or others may be harmed significantly if the information is not disclosed.

### More Background

According to the National Latino and Asian American Study, Asian Americans have a 17.3% lifetime rate of mental illness, yet Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health treatment than Whites. Youth with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable, because they often experience overwhelming barriers, such as stigma and shame. In fact, in 2017, suicide was the leading cause of death for Asian Americans ages 15 to 24. Youth mental and behavioral health among the Chinese American community is a serious problem, and it has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The time to address mental health within the Chinese American community is long overdue, which is why we seek to make our Peer Advisory Program a priority within our work.

There are many causes for the development of mental illnesses, but the parental pressure to succeed in academics continues to be a leading cause for mental illness among Chinese American youth. The harmful "model minority" stereotype creates additional pressure on Chinese American youth to succeed both within and outside of school. Other causes include:

•	Difficulty in balancing two different cultures and developing a bicultural sense of self  
•	Family obligations based on strong traditional and cultural values  
•	Racial or cultural discrimination  

Mental health stigma continues to persist in Chinese culture, particularly among parents and elders. As a result, Chinese American youth tend to dismiss or deny mental health symptoms, preventing them from seeking help from trusted adults and mental health professionals.
