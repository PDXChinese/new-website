Health matters to everyone, to the youth who grow in between two cultures, to the parents who shoulder the burden of raising family, and surely to the elderly who learn to age gracefully. The health fair eyes on the wellbeing of entire community.

As a community-based organization, its strength lies in addressing the root causes of both physical and mental health issues. The health fair is beyond just health education and screening. We will use it as an opportunity to introduce health and social service resources to the community members. We believe empowering people with the knowledge and resources is the best way to improve the public health.

# 2023华人社区健康博览会

此次由OCC主办的社区健康博览会定位在两个方面：第一，健康关乎每个人，关乎在两种文化中成长的青少年，关乎肩负养家重任的年轻的爸爸妈妈们，更关乎学会优雅老去的长者。健康博览会着眼于全体社区成员的福祉。第二，作为一个社区组织，我们看中的不仅仅是健康筛检和教育，更重要的是那些影响我们身心健康的社会因素，所以，我们也会邀请有关的服务机构团体和个人参加活动。令人欣慰的是，我们的定位受到广泛的认可和支持。
