Health matters to everyone, to the youth who grow in between two cultures, to the parents who shoulder the burden of raising family, and surely to the elderly who learn to age gracefully. The health fair eyes on the wellbeing of entire community.

As a community-based organization, its strength lies in addressing the root causes of both physical and mental heath issues. The health fair is beyond
 just for health education and screening. We will make it an opportunity to introduce all health and social service resources to the community members. We believe empowering people with the knowledge and resources is the best way to improve the public health.


*Full programs are in development and you have every reason to expect...*
