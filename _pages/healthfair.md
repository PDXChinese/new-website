**Date:** March 19, 2023 12pm-4pm  
**Place:** Embassy Suites by Hilton Portland Washington Square (9000 SW Washington Square Rd, Tigard, OR 97223)  

Health matters to everyone, to the youth who grow in between two cultures, to the parents who shoulder the burden of raising family, and surely to the elderly who learn to age gracefully. Our health fair eyes on the entire community.

As a CBO, its strength lies in addressing the root causes of both physical and mental heath issues. Our health fair is not just for health education and screening. We will make it an opportunity to introduce all health and social service resources to the community members. We believe empowering people with the knowledge and resources is the best way to improve the public health.
