Health matters to everyone, to the youth who grow in between two cultures, to the parents who shoulder the burden of raising family, and surely to the elderly who learn to age gracefully. The health fair eyes on the wellbeing of entire community.

As a community-based organization, its strength lies in addressing the root causes of both physical and mental health issues. The health fair is beyond just health education and screening. We will use it as an opportunity to introduce health and social service resources to the community members. We believe empowering people with the knowledge and resources is the best way to improve the public health.
