Designed by Sophia, Victoria's twin sister.

Victoria (Zifan) Ren was a student at Findley Elementary School, Beaverton Oregon. She passed away in 2017 after fighting a rare type of cancer for more than three years. [She was remembered by her teachers, classmates, friends and neighbors as a very beautiful, talented, and brave girl](https://pdxchinese.org/victoria-ren/). Victoria’s parents decided to set up Victoria Ren Scholarship to let her sweetest smile brighten other children in the community who need assistance emotionally and/or financially.

By the end of each school year, one scholarship will be awarded to a student of any age in the Chinese community. The recipient will receive $500. The selection will be made by the Advisory Committee and Victoria’s parents.
