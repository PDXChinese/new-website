Ms. Jones was a highly regarded human service administrator with 30 years of experience. Her expertise serving individuals, youth, families, veterans, refugees, immigrants, and people experiencing homelessness makes her ideal for the executive position. Over the course of her career, she’s elevated public/private partnerships, public health, child welfare, and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) programs, and was responsible for organizational strategy, nonprofit and change management, and capacity building.

In her previous role as Vice President of Programs at Abode Services in Northern California she led Permanent Supportive Housing and other housing services as a preferred provider in Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and San Mateo counties. Ms. Jones managed a multi-million-dollar budget, and in partnership with her dedicated leadership team provided oversight to multiple programs and 200 staff.

Founded in 1889 as an orphanage for abandoned and wayward children, today St. Mary’s offers residential treatment and services to at-risk boys between the ages of 10 and 17 who are emotionally disturbed and behaviorally delinquent.  The individualized program provides each client with a structured regimen to ensure his successful transition to public school, the community, and appropriate living environment. Adolescent boys of all ethnic heritages and religious backgrounds are accepted.

### Raymond Chong

"As a sixth generation American Born Chinese (ABC), I grew up in a barrio (neighborhood) of Elysian Valley near Chinatown of Los Angeles, City of Angels, in California, The Golden State of America - Gold Mountain. I was vaguely aware of my Chinese heritage and was utterly ignorant of my Zhang clan ancestry. My narrow realm was Chinatown and Little Tokyo in Downtown. I ate our Chop Suey, Cantonese cuisine. I attended family affairs. I celebrated traditional festivals. But I was a jook sing, bamboo rod, one who looked Chinese (solid) outside but who thought American (hollow) inside.

I quietly lived and studied in an insular enclave of Chinese from Canton with dark secrets, a dreadful legacy of racist Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), paper son scheme, and Chinese Confession Program (1956-1965) during the scary Red Menace. As a youth, my parents and elders never shared their tales about our forefathers nor their lives in Kaiping. Except for brief forays into Chinatown, I knew very little about China, an exotic world in a far place, and had no reverent respect for my Zhang elders or my Chinese heritage.

After a defining moment on a stark winter day of January 30, 2003, my life paradigm drastically changed. It has led me to My Kaiping Journey - From Gold Mountain to Dragon Hill Village."
