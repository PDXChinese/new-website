Founded in 1889 as an orphanage for abandoned and wayward children, today St. Mary’s offers residential treatment and services to at-risk boys between the ages of 10 and 17 who are emotionally disturbed and behaviorally delinquent.  The individualized program provides each client with a structured regimen to ensure his successful transition to public school, the community, and appropriate living environment. Adolescent boys of all ethnic heritages and religious backgrounds are accepted.

"As a sixth generation American Born Chinese (ABC), I grew up in a barrio (neighborhood) of Elysian Valley near Chinatown of Los Angeles, City of Angels, in California, The Golden State of America - Gold Mountain. I was vaguely aware of my Chinese heritage and was utterly ignorant of my Zhang clan ancestry. My narrow realm was Chinatown and Little Tokyo in Downtown. I ate our Chop Suey, Cantonese cuisine. I attended family affairs. I celebrated traditional festivals. But I was a jook sing, bamboo rod, one who looked Chinese (solid) outside but who thought American (hollow) inside.

I quietly lived and studied in an insular enclave of Chinese from Canton with dark secrets, a dreadful legacy of racist Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), paper son scheme, and Chinese Confession Program (1956-1965) during the scary Red Menace. As a youth, my parents and elders never shared their tales about our forefathers nor their lives in Kaiping. Except for brief forays into Chinatown, I knew very little about China, an exotic world in a far place, and had no reverent respect for my Zhang elders or my Chinese heritage.

After a defining moment on a stark winter day of January 30, 2003, my life paradigm drastically changed. It has led me to My Kaiping Journey - From Gold Mountain to Dragon Hill Village."
