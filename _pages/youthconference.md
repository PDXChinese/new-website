Nguyen, a small-business owner who is perhaps best known for his Bambuza Vietnamese restaurants, became the first person of color elected to Lake Oswego council last November. Nguyen's campaign focused on making sure all Lake Oswegans have the same opportunity to thrive, whether that be through encouraging the development of affordable housing, improving diversity among City staff or simply fostering public participation on local issues. His parents came to the United States from Vietnam as refugees in 1975 and settled in Camas, Wash., where Nguyen grew up.

### Dr. William Toepper

Dr. Toepper, former Legacy Hospital emergency physician, organized and led Portland Street Medicine. "This is a crisis of monumental proportions, and no single person or organization can solve this alone," Williams says of what he sees as a growing number of homeless people, including a coming wave of baby boomers who did not prepare for retirement. "One of the things we hope to accomplish is to help fill gaps in services and these three initiatives meet a critical need right now on the streets of our city."
