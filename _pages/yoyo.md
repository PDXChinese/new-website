The Dragonfly Yo-Yo Team emerged in the spring of 2023, born out of the pandemic, as community youth turned to this activity for both enjoyment and the cultivation of robust mental resilience. The team made its inaugural performance debut at the Youth Conference, followed by a captivating appearance on the Festival stage at Pioneer Square during the summer.

To book their performance, please contact [info@pdxchinese.org](mailto:info@pdxchinese.org). They will love to show off their culture in the community events.
