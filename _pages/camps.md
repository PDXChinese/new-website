# Parents-Organized Tours/Camps for Community Youth

We encourage parents who have the resources to organize the tours/camps in their workplaces or any other institutions with the goal to provide the community youth the learning opportunity with the close-up observation to the work environment and direct communication with the experts.

To talk about the potential for such tours/camps, please [contact us](http://pdxchinese.org/contact/).

The camps/tours open to all youth in the community. When the space is limited, priority will be given to the families who are in several volunteering WeChat groups.
