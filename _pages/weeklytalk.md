How to Pursue Your Passion and Reach Your Full Potential

{% include feature_row id="feature_row12"%}

Eric Priest is a professor at the University of Oregon School of Law, but he took an unusual route to get there. After graduating from high school, Eric took time off to pursue his passion: writing and recording music. He worked multiple jobs as a daycare teacher and cook to save money to build a home recording studio. In the end, he spent a decade as a songwriter and music producer with multiple hit songs in the 1990s. In his late 20s, he moved to China to study Mandarin and Chinese culture. In the years that followed, he attended law school in the U.S., worked as an intellectual property attorney, returned to school to earn a graduate degree at Harvard Law School, and was sent back to China to be CEO of a Harvard spin-off company in Beijing. Since joining the faculty at Oregon Law, his research has combined his greatest interests—music, copyright law, and China—and he has become one of the U.S.'s foremost experts on Chinese copyright law.
