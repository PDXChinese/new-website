# President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA)

OCC has been approved as an official Certifying Organization for The President's Volunteer Service Award. We encourage community members, especially youth, to get involved in all the volunteer activities by taking advantage of this platform.

To be qualified as a volunteer for PVSA awards under OCC, you will have to (1) meet the [requirements by PVSA](https://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/eligibility) **AND** (2) fill out and sign OCC's [PVSA Volunteer Supplemental Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn2_Mz3uZ6ghY64BRqC696LkbrRbGoJEH2eRUdX33zT_Fedw/viewform?c=0&w=1).

You will be responsible for recording hours after each volunteer activity. Also please keep the volunteer hour logs for future verification. OCC provides you an [hour log sheet](/assets/pdf/volunteer_hour_log_sheet.pdf) for your convenience.

What counts as volunteer hours? We recommend a few online articles ([No.1](https://www.realizedworth.com/2018/07/19/what-counts-as-volunteer-time/), [No.2](https://www.gswny.org/content/dam/girlscouts-gswny/documents/presidents%20volunteer%20service%20award%20service%20hours%20guidelines.pdf), [No.3](http://www.gscwm.org/content/dam/girlscouts-gscwm/documents/GSCWM%20guidelines%20for%20Hours%20for%20PVSA.pdf)) for your reference. Even though we request supervisor's signature and possible hour log verification, it is still up to the volunteers themselves to report hours with the highest level of integrity.

Hours are measured over a 12-month period (Oct 27 through Oct 26) and awards are designated based on cumulative hours. The awards are offered in multiple levels and are designed to recognize each milestone of your service achievement. Levels include bronze, silver, gold and the highest honor, the President’s Lifetime Achievement Award for those who contribute more than 4,000 hours of service in their lifetime.

Once the documentation is received via email ([volunteer@pdxchinese.org](mailto:volunteer@pdxchinese.org)) by announced deadline, OCC will verify all records and confirm that the candidate has completed the number of service hours in good standing as required to earn a President’s Volunteer Service Award.

请进《兰苏园汉语角志愿者》群，方便报名和商量细节。

花园会有当值的VEC (visitor experience coordinator)，因为是周二下午，很多时候可能会是Venus本人当值，我们会在活动前半小时把桌椅架设好，准备好热茶，在现场等您们。当次的志愿者只要直接从花园前门进来，无须买票，直接告知门口的greeter您是OCC conversation table的volunteer就可以直接进来。Greeter会告知您您们在哪一个房间。如果当下有任何问题请，直接致电当值的VEC手机(503)348-9157。

花园内不能用自己带来的吃食，饮品类只要是有盖子的都行，如果需要用点餐点，可以在活动之前或是之后去花园茶楼，他们供应简单的茶点及蒸饺包子类。现场我们会提供一壶茶楼的热茶跟杯子，供大家及参与的访客享用。

志愿者不能擅自挪动或者触碰园内或厅内的家具和展物，尽可能不要遮挡墙上的展物，因为游人需要能看到它们。
