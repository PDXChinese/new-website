**Time:** 5-6:30pm, every Saturday   
**Place:** [Hope Chinese Charter School](https://hopeccs.org/)  

Club members play and jam on guitars individually and/or collaboratively in styles of their choice. Veteran players share their knowledge with novice players and presentations from guest guitarists throughout the year.

OCC actively organizes and participates in community events held in senior homes, community centers, and schools. Club members are encouraged to perform at these events.

OCC has six guitars donated by [Natasha Guitars](https://natashaguitar.com/). Students can borrow them based on their needs.
