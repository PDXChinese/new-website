# 木兰鼓队 / Mulan Drum Team

Chinese drum culture has a long history, and the drum is a symbol of spirit. The Mulan Drum Team is a volunteer organization of OCC. Since its establishment, it has actively performed in the communities. At art festivals, nursing homes, schools and other venues, the sound is entrancing,  strong and loud. It echoes the beauty and intelligence of Chinese women, and contributes to the celebration of Chinese culture in our community.

To have us perform in your events, please [contact us](http://pdxchinese.org/contact/).
