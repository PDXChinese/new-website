### Artistic Theme and Message:

The purpose of this activity is to encourage youth to get outdoors with their families. Therefore, the submitted artwork must be focused around an individual’s experience in nature. It is asked of the contestants that part of your process needs to be spending time in nature to become inspired. The hope is that individuals will come to understand that nature is everywhere. It can be found in their backyard, down the block, at their school, or in a designated space like a refuge. To provide some guidance of the topic to consider, the committee has posed a question to reflect on as contestants imagine what they want to create. Think about and reflect on this:

<b>“The Wonder of Nature”</b>

We request that youth entering the contest find ways to explore nature, in ways that they are able to, in order to find what inspires them. This is important as one of the submission rules is to provide a written explanation of their experience and where their inspiration came from while spending time (in whatever way they can) with nature. This write needs to be 150 or less and help the judges understand why the contestant created the piece they submitted. The submission needs to be provided when handing over the artwork.

### Judging:

-	All phases of judging will be open to general public (unless COVID restrictions do not allow for large numbers in a room at a time).  
-	The six judges will represent members from The Friends of TRNWRC, USFWS/TRNWRC and the OCC  
-	Judges will utilize a rubric when evaluating the submission. Value will be placed on creative expression, overall impact and technique. In the result of a tie, the winner will be determined by the President of the Friends.  
-	Artwork will be judged by group level as follows: Grades K-3, Grades 4-6, Grades 7-9, Grades 10-12  
-	Awards will be selected by level. Each level will have a First Place, Second Place and Third Place winner, one each. There can be up to 4 Honorable mentions, depending on the number of entries. One entry will be selected as “Best of Show”  

### Recognition:

-	All entries will receive certificates from The Friends, the Refuge and OCC.  
-	Each honorable mention will receive a special recognition certificate.  
-	Each First, Second and Third Place winners will receive a special recognition certificate, ribbon and prize provide by the Friends.  
-	The “Best of Show” winner will receive a prize of $500 from the OCC
