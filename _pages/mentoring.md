## Community Mentors

We encourage community members to become a mentor for our kids. Mentoring is always a huge gap in our community. We all know it but always lack of actions. Don't need to be perfect, you can gain experience along the way. Nothing in this world can be more rewarded than growing up with the kids around you.

## National Mentoring Month

The website is full of resources. Both mentors and mentees are encouraged to explore the site to get the most out of this experience.
