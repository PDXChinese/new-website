## Community Mentors

We encourage community members to become a mentor for our kids. Mentoring is always a huge gap in our community. We all know it but always lack of actions. Don't need to be perfect, you can gain experience along the way. Nothing in this world can be more rewarded than growing up with the kids around you.

All mentors are encouraged to have at least one face to face meeting with their mentees and then maintain future communication via social media or emails if needed.
