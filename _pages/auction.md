## Still Open: Fundraising Auction for Lan Su Chinese Garden 为兰苏园筹款拍卖

This event is organized by the Friends of Lan Su Chinese Garden in the Chinese American community, not affiliated with Lan Su Chinese Garden.

There will be no admin cost or commission for the auctions. 100% proceeds go to Lan Su Chinese Garden. The amount combined with cash donations will be delivered to Lan Su late October by OCC.

All items will be in donor's possession until being picked up by the winning bidders. Payment will be made to OCC with the methods listed on [OCC Donate page](https://pdxchinese.org/communityfund/).

OCC will provide donation receipts to the donors upon request.

所有收入会捐赠给兰苏园，拍卖所得款额连同现金捐款会在10月底由OCC转给兰苏园。所有拍卖品在中标人领取之前会由捐赠者保存，中标者付款方式参见OCC网站上的Donate(捐赠)页面。OCC可以为捐赠人提供收据。
