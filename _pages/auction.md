## 2021 fundraising auction for Lan Su Chinese Garden

This event is organized by the Friends of Lan Su Chinese Garden in the Chinese American community, not affiliated with Lan Su Chinese Garden.

There will be no admin cost or commission for the auctions. 100% proceeds go to Lan Su Chinese Garden. The amount combined with cash donations will be delivered to Lan Su late October by OCC.

All items will be in donor's possession until being picked up by the winning bidders. Payment will be made to OCC with the methods listed on [OCC Donate page](https://pdxchinese.org/communityfund/).

OCC will provide donation receipts to both donors and winning bidders upon request.
