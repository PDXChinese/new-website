All items will be in donor's possession until being picked up by the winning bidders. Payment will be made to OCC with the methods listed on [OCC Donate page](https://pdxchinese.org/communityfund/).

OCC will provide donation receipts to the donors upon request.

所有收入会捐赠给兰苏园，拍卖所得款额连同现金捐款会在10月底由OCC转给兰苏园。所有拍卖品在中标人领取之前会由捐赠者保存，中标者付款方式参见OCC网站上的Donate(捐赠)页面。OCC可以为捐赠人提供收据。
