### About Oak Hill School: Our Mission & Philosophy

Founded in 1994 and accredited by the Northwest Association of Independent Schools, Oak Hill School in Eugene, Oregon, is a secular (non-religious), private school offering a well-rounded pre-kindergarten through 8th grade education. Our goal is to inspire intellectual curiosity, creativity and critical thinking and to promote physical well-being, respect for others, moral fortitude and a global mindset.

### Foreign Languages

Two foreign languages are taught at Oak Hill School: Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. Grades K-2 learn both languages and have the opportunity to choose which of the two they would like to pursue in grades 3-8. In addition to the languages, students are immersed in the history and traditions of each culture. When students enter an area high school, they are more than prepared to further their foreign language education.
