## The GIS Chinese track incorporates select proven Chinese-based methods with the renowned whole-child approach of the International Baccalaureate program to offer a truly immersive and well-rounded education for age 2 through grade 8.

### Truly immersive education

Students spend most of their day hearing, speaking, reading, and writing in Chinese in most subjects, including in art for grade school and in music for early learning. Teachers and assistants in language-based classes, including math, are native or near-native Chinese speakers. You can read our teacher bios and educational backgrounds here.

As an international, language-immersion school, GIS families are a multicultural, diverse community and students experience cross-cultural learning throughout the year with holiday celebrations, special events, combined track activities, and more.

GIS is an IB PYP World School, so teachers actively resource and customize, in Chinese, lessons and curriculum that align with the IB themes of the year, cross-referenced with Common Core Standards, Chinese national curriculum standards, and ACTFL standards. Instruction is differentiated for students in each grade level.
