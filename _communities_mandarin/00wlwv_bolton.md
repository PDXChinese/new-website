### Mandarin Chinese Dual Language Program in Grades K-5

Our Chinese Dual Language Program begins with kindergarten in Fall 2022 at Bolton Primary School.  The program follows a 50:50 model with 50% of the instruction in Mandarin Chinese and 50% of the instruction in English.  The program at Bolton is primarily a one-way immersion program because the majority of students are native English speakers, learning Chinese as their second language.

### Mandarin Chinese Dual Language Program in Grades 6-12

Beginning in Fall 2022 with kindergarten, there will be a grade level added each school year to the one-way immersion program.  Students will continue with the Chinese Dual Language Program at Athey Creek Middle School.  Chinese Dual Language courses will be offered at West Linn and Wilsonville High Schools.
