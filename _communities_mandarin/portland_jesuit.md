In a rapidly-globalizing world, there is a greater need for the understanding and comprehension of languages and cultures different than our own. The World Languages Department seeks to create students who are aware of the international world and open to new cultures and experiences. This is done through a variety of language courses and levels; we hope students can engage world languages in a manner both challenging and eye-opening. To complete the World Language requirement for graduation, students must complete two consecutive years in the same language.

Freshmen testing at high levels of proficiency may be placed in a higher level course, taking into consideration both performance on the Placement Exam and studentsâ€™ background in the language.
