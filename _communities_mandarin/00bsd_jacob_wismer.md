We are thrilled to launch our very first Dual Language Mandarin Chinese Program at Jacob Wismer Elementary School!

This year, we have two Dual Language English/Mandarin Chinese classrooms at the Kindergarten level, and we currently have a few spots available. These spots will remain open until they are filled. If you are interested in joining us, or if you would like more information or have any questions about the Dual Language Mandarin Chinese Program, please feel free to contact Shuhan Rui, the program TOSA/Coordinator, at shuhan_rui@beaverton.k12.or.us.
