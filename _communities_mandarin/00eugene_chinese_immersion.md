### Mission Statement:

The Chinese Language Immersion School provides a rigorous, supportive Mandarin immersion program which enables our students to become biliterate in Mandarin and English. The program also provides them opportunities to develop strong cross-cultural understanding and appreciation for Chinese culture with the goal of becoming productive global citizens.

Research indicates bilingual students gain deeper insights into ways of thinking and expressing themselves. Learning two languages increases the strength of literacy in both. Skills acquired include:

High level of proficiency in literacy and math skills in both English and Mandarin

Appreciation of multiple cultures and sensitivity to people who speak other languages

Foundations of knowledge in other curriculum areas, such as science and social studies

Flexibility of thinking and creative problem solving
