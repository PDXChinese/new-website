### Our history

The first school in the Sisters school district, then District #9, Crook County, was built about 1885 although Crook County records show money had been allotted to the district in 1883. There were 30 children on the census in 1885.

### Mandarin Chinese Programs in Sisters

"We offer Chinese in six levels in the Sisters School District. Students can begin Chinese at the Middle School, as early as the seventh grade, and can complete two years of Chinese for high school credit before beginning the ninth grade at the high school. They can merge into Chinese 3 at that time, if they so choose that option. Students who begin Chinese upon entering high school can complete up to four years of Chinese, if they so choose. Chinese 4 and 5 are AP courses. "
