### Mandarin at PWS

Portland Waldorf School has long committed to offering two world languages to our students, with a focus on culture, conversation and story in the early years, as children begin their journey with new languages. Steiner said that each language expresses a human element in a different way. For instance, one language might work on the will, whereas another might work on the thinking or feeling life. When children are exposed to multiple languages from a young age, they become more well-rounded and develop more fully as human beings and citizens of the world.

After much study and discussion last Spring, the College of Teachers decided that the addition of Mandarin Chinese would enhance our rich curriculum and reflect our school community. We are so eager for our students to learn to speak, write and sing in Chinese - and learn about Chinese culture from a native speaker.
