This course is an introduction to Mandarin Chinese, the official language of China. The emphasis will be on spoken Mandarin. Students will learn how to handle everyday situations, explain their life, family, interests, pastimes and more.  Although oral communication will be our focus, learning to read and write simplified Chinese characters will also be an important part of the class. Together we will explore many interesting aspects of Chinese culture and history.
