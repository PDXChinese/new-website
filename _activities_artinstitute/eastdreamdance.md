The mission of the non-profit East Dream Chinese Dance Group is, primarily, to enrich diversity within our local community by offering demonstrations of uniquely Chinese traditions and rituals. We, the members of the dance troupe, all have different backgrounds, different professions, and different outlooks, but we still see one common goal: to share Chinese culture through music and dance. It is our ultimate objective not only to maintain this vibrant thread of Chinese culture through our future generations, but also to disseminate our heritage within the rest of our community by learning, teaching, and performing different kinds of Chinese music and dance.
