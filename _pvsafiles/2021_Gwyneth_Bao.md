# Gwyneth Bao - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 112**  

Gwyneth is a sophomore at Lincoln High School. After seeing the homeless community on the streets of Portland suffering from the long-lasting effects of the pandemic, she knew she needed to help. She started looking for ways to reduce food insecurity, starting with volunteering at Clay Street Table every Thursday to bag and deliver food to elders and the homeless community. She has since been co-leading the FlockFeast club at her school to provide the same services to Lincoln families in need of food. Her work has inspired her to translate these passions into serving as a role model of good health and citizenship by volunteering at Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital, where she works in administration, provides transport, and assists at the hospice. Within the hospital environment, she has the opportunity to gain valuable experiences that align with her future goals. From these experiences, Gwyneth has made it her mission to inspire positive change and create a more equitable world by devoting her time to improving the well-being of the community.  

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Gwyneth Bao.
