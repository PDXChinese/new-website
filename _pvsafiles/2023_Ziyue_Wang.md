Yueyue (Ziyue) is an active freshman attending LHS.

Yueyue and her friends thrive toward providing a warm dinner for these patients and families going through an uneasy time.

Volunteering has always been an opportunity filled with heartwarming atmosphere and environment. In addition, Yueyue is actively thriving within PHFU club created by OCC. She performed within numerous festivals and events to fully unveil and unleash the power of Chinese culture and heritage through colorful depiction of traditional Chinese Hanfu. Yueyue has strong passion and spirit for volunteering in various groups and community work.
