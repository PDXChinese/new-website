Cherry is currently a junior at Lincoln High School. This year, she became an Executive Director of [Mission: Citizen](https://missioncitizen.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to helping immigrants pass the naturalization test and become effective US citizens. As Executive Director, she plans and leads discussions surrounding citizenship classes, promotions, grants, fundraisers, and scholarships. She also teaches in-person lessons to students seeking citizenship on a weekly basis. She is passionate about promoting access to resources for the citizenship exam and increasing civic engagement in her community. Simplifying the naturalization process is something she continues to work on and fight for. Additionally, Cherry works to reduce food insecurity as co-president of the FlockFeast service club. There, she provides groceries for Lincoln families in need, and she assists in the planning process of each monthâ€™s Asian Food Pantry at [Clay Street Table](https://claystreettable.org/). She has also volunteered at [Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center](https://www.legacyhealth.org/doctors-and-locations/hospitals/legacy-good-samaritan-medical-center), working in administration, providing transport for medical equipment, and assisting at the hospice. Her work in the hospital environment has given her the opportunity to curate a genuine desire to help others, gain valuable experiences in the medical field, and pursue something that aligns with her future career goals. From these experiences, Cherry strives to continue her mission of improving the lives of others and making a positive impact on her community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Cherry Chen.
