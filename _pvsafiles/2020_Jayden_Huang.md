# Jayden Huang - Bronze Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 63**  

Jayden is a freshman at Sunset High School. He enjoys reading and writing but mostly learning about politics and history. He applied his knowledge and interests to his volunteering. Jayden primarily volunteered for Youthlink. He taught lessons to elementary school students based on his expertise. His favorite class to teach was a History Bowl class. History Bowl is a national competition where teams of participants try to be the first to answer a question. Jayden has done this competition for 3 years and counting. He enjoyed it because it allowed him to share his interest in history with other like-minded people. He enjoyed seeing a mirrored version of himself in all of the enthusiastic students who were excited to be able to use their knowledge in a competitive format. Through his volunteering, Jayden was able to gain valuable experience working with different people and leading others. He learned as much from those he taught as they did from him.  

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jayden Huang.
