# Sophia Wang - Bronze Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 58**  

I am a current sophomore at Sunset High School. I have grown up and fostered good memories and experiences in many different communities—the STEM community, the robotics community, the Speech and Debate community, and importantly, the greater Portland community—and I am passionate about reciprocating and giving back to these communities what I have been given. This is why, over the past year, I strived to give back to all. I have volunteered extensively at the Transition Projects Clark Center Shelter, which helped me realize my love for making a visible difference in the lives of the people around me. Moreover, I taught coding and algorithms to elementary school girls with Girls Who Code and helped reset official tournament fields at the VIQC Robotics State Championships. Finally, I have volunteered at middle school Speech and Debate tournaments, both judging speech and debate rounds and supervising teams. All these experiences have helped me realize how important it is to help my community and I have made it my mission to make this world a better place.

Outside of volunteering, I enjoy running cross country and being an active Tournament-of-Champions-qualifying member of the Speech and Debate community at Sunset. As an artist, I have placed in many national wildlife-based art competitions dedicated to preserving wildlife and conservation. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, and painting.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophia Wang.
