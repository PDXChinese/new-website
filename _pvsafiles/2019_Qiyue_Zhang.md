# Qiyue Cheery Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 108**  

Qiyue (Cheery) is a freshman at Westview High School. Over the years of taking Ping Pong, Guzheng, and art classes, she noticed how privileged she was in comparison to those less fortunate kids. After observing first hand that many kids around her even had to skip meals, not to mention taking extracurricular classes, Cheery knew she needed to do something to help them. She started volunteering at the Oregon Food Bank, a state-wide organization that provides lower-income people with food. From the bulk amounts of vegetables she and other volunteers repacked, Cheery was more troubled to see that many families out there needed help. But at the same time, she also saw the impact each person had on our community by just committing one morning every week to volunteering. Over time, Cheery has found herself enjoying all types of hands-on community service. Because of her interest in the arts, she has taken up multiple opportunities to perform Guzheng at Lansu Garden, senior homes, and other charity events, as well as design posters for Pioneer Square Chinese Festival. Now in high school, Cheery strives more than ever to set a good example for the younger kids around her and to show everyone how important it is to serve community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Qiyue Zhang.
