# Sophia Hu - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 174**  

Sophia is a 10th grader at Catlin Gabel School. Over the last year, she volunteered as a Guide and Healing Through Music volunteer at the Oregon Health & Science University, meaning she played music in the children's hospital lobby to create a peaceful atmosphere and helped out at the front desk to guide people. She also helped out at other OHSU events, such as their See, Test, Treat program where women in underserved communities are given free mammograms. Sophia volunteers at the Hillsboro library, and contributes to the summer reading program, book sales, and events for children. She enjoys volunteering at OHSU because it helps her learn about the healthcare industry, and because she can share her music skills. Sophia enjoys volunteering at the library because she loves reading and can share her joy with others.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophia Hu.
