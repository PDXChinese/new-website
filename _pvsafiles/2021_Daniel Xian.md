# Daniel Xian - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 107**  

Daniel is a sophomore at Catlin Gabel School. Building stuff from scratch is always his passion ever since he was kid and it leads his interest in STEM at school. He has participated multiple building related science competitions since middle school. His favorite sports are ice hokey and Martial Arts, both of which he practices for 7+ years.

Pandemic has been with us for two years. It not only changes out life, but impacts the mental health, especially for kids and teens. The one-and-half years school shut-down isolates us from our peers both physically and mentally. He peered his friend to do an intensive research on how the isolation, even with online learning, affected the mental health of teens. With interviews of friends around us, a video is created to arouse attention of this issue to students and their parents. Realizing that many kidsâ€™ academy is impacted by the pandemic, he is planning to provide free tutoring in the coming year, especially to those extra lessons might be not affordable otherwise. While he was doing his summer internship, he served as a volunteer TA helping kids to get their hands on coding experience.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Daniel Xian.
