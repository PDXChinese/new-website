# Susan Moseley - Bronze Award

**School: St. Stephen's Episcopal School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 56**  

Susan Moseley is a freshman at St. Stephen’s Episcopal School, and loves working to help the community and the people surrounding her. Growing up learning Chinese and finding a deep love for the culture, Susan aspired to foster a love for learning Chinese in younger students around her as well. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting quarantine, Susan taught weekly Chinese lessons online with Oregon Hope Chinese School, planning classwork ahead of time and encouraging students to use the language more to express their own interests as well. Not only did this allow them to improve their skills, Susan also formed strong bonds and connections with her students. Susan has also worked as a volunteer at Art World School’s Summer Camp, working to encourage a love of art in students. Through the various activities, including painting, pottery, and calligraphy, she helped them visualize and make their artistic ideas a reality. Through teaching others, Susan expanded her own worldview and knowledge as well. Currently, she continues her efforts helping others around her as a representative of her school’s Chinese Culture Club and as a member of the school Dorm Council.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Susan Moseley.
