# Derica Theobald - Bronze Award

**School: Sexton Mountain Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 31**  

Derica is a fifth grader at Sexton Mountain Elementary School.  Having an inherently empathetic personality makes helping others come to her naturally.  When the supervisor of the local Elks’ Antlers program attended by her sister asked for help with their bake sale event, Derica responded with no hesitation. Besides helping Antlers’ fundraising, she arranged collection buckets at school to gather donations of warm winter clothing and hygiene products for Clay Street Table.  She also donated birthday money she received from relatives to buy books for underprivileged students as part of Planting Seeds annual holiday project.  She brought Christmas Spirit to the Springs of Clackamas Woods retirement homes with singers from Pacific Youth Choir.

Derica is part of a non-profit organization called Let’s Peer Up. LPU helps people with disabilities. She delivered a speech at the Beaverton City Council meeting.  With the effort of Derica and other LPU members, the City of Beaverton is in the process of reinstating a Committee/Board to serve people with physical and mental disabilities.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Derica Theobald.
