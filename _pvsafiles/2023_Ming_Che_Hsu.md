# Ming Che Hsu - Silver Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 90**  

I'm a 15-year-old boy originally from Taiwan, now navigating life in Portland, Oregon. I am a sophomore at Westview High School, and I find joy in badminton and excel in VEX robotics, leading team 1158X to represent Oregon in the world championships last season, and consistently leading my team for better results this season right now.  Art and sports captivate me, fostering a balanced life. Since age six, I've cultivated a passion for mechanical engineering, supplementing it with a deep dive into various programming languages. My goal is to become an engineering expert, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge cultivated since childhood. I see my journey as a perpetual quest for excellence, with each step propelling me toward a future where innovation and expertise converge in the realm of engineering.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award to Ming Che Hsu.
