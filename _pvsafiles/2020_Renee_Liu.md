# Renee Liu - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 270**  

Renee is a freshman at Lake Oswego High School. After learning Java(computer science language) a few years ago, Renee aspired to teach some of her knowledge about it back to the community. Therefore, she started classes at Oregon Hope Chinese School, where she taught for about one full year, four different terms, of Java! She has taught four different levels of Java that increase in difficulty. Each level covers one term, a period of ten classes of one hour each. She hopes that every one of her students has learned something valuable that can be taken with them to their future careers.

Renee has also been a teacher assistant(TA) for MLP 8(Chinese grade 8) at Oregon Hope Chinese School, where she creates activities to engage the students in learning Chinese. Through the activities, she hopes to encourage the learning of Chinese and the spreading of Chinese culture. She sincerely thanks everyone who has helped her become who she is today.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Renee Liu.
