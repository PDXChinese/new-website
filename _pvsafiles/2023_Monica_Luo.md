# Monica Luo - Gold Award

**School: International School of Beaverton**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 101.5**  

My name is Monica Luo, and I am an eighth grade student at the International School of Beaverton. Aside from school, I participate in various extracurricular activities like VEX VRC Robotics, rhythmic gymnastics, ballet, guitar, and traditional Chinese dance. This year I did lots of volunteer work regarding VEX IQ robotics, Chinese dance, etc.

One of the main parts of my volunteer work includes refereeing VEX IQ competitions, in which I am the youngest referee in the state. I attended various VEX IQ competitions as a referee, including the world championships in Dallas, Texas. I enjoy being the referee for these competitions because I also participate in robotics, just at a higher level called VRC. Chinese dance performances have also been an enjoyable part of my volunteering experiences. I like sharing my culture with people and entertaining them with the art of dance. Other things I participated in include helping food banks hand out food and cook for a staff meeting at my school.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Monica Luo.
