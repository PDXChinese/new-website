# Carol_Wang - Silver Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 81**  

I go to Jesuit High School as a sophomore. I enjoy Volunteering, art, and having fun. This year I joined the OCC Jade dance team and I also started volunteering alot more with the Lake Oswego Lions. I really enjoy impacting making  new friends while volunteering and helping the community. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Carol Wang.
