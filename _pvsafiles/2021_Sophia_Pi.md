# Sophia Pi - Silver Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 202**  

Sophia has been volunteering with PJS since 10th grade and was selected to be on the leadership team (serving as the Volunteer Coordinator) in 11th and 12th grade. Every week, she makes lesson plans for interactive science experiments, purchases and organizes the necessary equipment, coordinate volunteers (emails, organizing time slots, ensuring all the logistics go smoothly, etc), and leads volunteering sessions themselves. During these weekly volunteering sessions, PJS travels to Title 1 elementary schools (Greenway Elementary School and McKay Elementary School) to teach interactive science experiments to students from underrepresented backgrounds. Within the span of one year, she grew PJS from just 20 volunteers to 73 volunteers. She spends about 4+ hours every week volunteering for PJS.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophia Pi.
