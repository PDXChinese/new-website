# Aaron Guo - Silver Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 76**  

Iâ€™m a sophomore at Sunset High School, and love to help the community. I like to help teach and immerse people into STEM topics, especially science.

I have been volunteering since the start of March 2022. I have been teaching various members of the public, whether as young as toddlers or as old as adults, about STEM, specifically science. We do this through the use of demos that the volunteer group members have made themselves. Other than that, we also publish educational demo videos on a YouTube channel teaching science for the public to learn science in a more exciting manner.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Aaron Fu.
