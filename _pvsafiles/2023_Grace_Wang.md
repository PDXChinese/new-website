# Grace Wang - Bronze Award

**School: Tumwater Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 62**  

My name is Grace Wang and I go to Tumwater middle school! I love to swim every day and I also love to paint and draw sketches during my free time! I have been doing many things to help people with disabilities when I have time. This includes volunteering at organizations that are targeted to Down syndrome and blindness! I also helped with serving food to raise money for the Lions Club.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Grace Wang.
