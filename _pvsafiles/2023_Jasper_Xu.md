# Jasper Xu - Silver Award

**School: Bridlemile Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 60**  

I’m eight years old I am in third grade in Bridlemile elementary school. This year I volunteered for 60 hours. During the Winter drive we collected lots of clothes for people in need. I also volunteered for the Transaction project where I made broccoli and cut grapes for their residents.  On culture day I taught people how to solve Chinese puzzles.  I signed the No Smoke No Vaping Pledge I also convinced others to sign as well.

I joined the Dragonfly Yoyo team this year and practiced every week. I’m so happy to learn how to play this Chinese traditional toy and get the chance to perform in the OCC Youth Conference and the Chinese festival.  I’m also happy that I was able to teach people Chinese Yoyo in the Lan Su Chinese Garden.
 
I am happy to learn, play, and serve my community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jasper Xu.
