# Xirui (Thomas) Jin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 106.3**  

I'm currently a Senior at Westview High School. Originally from Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, I came to live in Portland in the 3rd grade together with my parents. I have a good command of both spoken and written Chinese. I have been learning to play the Chinese Bamboo Flute since 1st grade, playing Bamboo Flute helps me to better understand traditional Chinese culture. I proudly serve as the Captain and President of Robotics Team 16689A and lead the Robotics Club, Dracobots. I'm a dedicated swimmer, swimming for my club and the Westview Swim Team  . Additionally, I'm a cadet in the Washington County Search and Rescue program, as I believe in the transformative power of volunteering and community service. My aim is to continue participating in these endeavors and contributing positively to our community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Xirui Jin.
