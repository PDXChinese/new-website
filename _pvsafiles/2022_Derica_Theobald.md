# Derica Theobald - Gold Award

**School: Whitford Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 125.5**  

Derica is a 7th grade Summa student at Whitford Middle school.  With innate humanity and leadership, Derica not only endeavors to bring positive impacts to the community, but also to empower those around her.  

Derica volunteers at different cultural events, public libraries, Portland downtown cleanups, sports clubs, and her cadet program's community service projects.  But for the past couple of years, her volunteering focus has been mainly on Covid relief and many of the Elks' charity projects.  Derica spent much time helping Oregon's number one immunization pharmacy LeCare for its walk-in vaccine program.  In her time there she has helped thousands get vaccinated, with the largest number she helped in a single day being three hundred.  She has been helping many of her friends to cope with mental health stress during the pandemic's isolation.  Derica has helped in many of the Elks' programs such as holiday food and toy drives, Christmas gift envelope decorating, and fundraising for Camp Meadowood Springs (for special needs kids).  The funds Derica raised ranked in the top 3 among all students.  

With the understanding that she was born lucky in many ways, Derica has been striving to share and spread her good fortune to others.  Through her efforts, Derica is thrilled to make differences in the community, and aims to build a more equitable world as a life-long goal.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Derica Theobald.
