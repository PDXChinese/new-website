Erika is a junior at Lincoln High School in Portland. She's most passionate about community aid through education and activism, devoting a majority of her community service hours to mentoring youth and environmental justice. As co-president of her school's [Model United Nations](https://unausa.org/model-un/), she taught her peers how to become more globally-minded learners and speakers. As a [Constitution Team](https://classroomlaw.org/student-programs/we-the-people/) mentor, she taught underclassmen the importance of civic engagement. Erika has also dedicated much of her time to various climate-related projects as president of the Lincoln Environmental Justice Club and regional leader for [Oregon Our Future Network](https://www.ourfutureoregon.org/). Just this year she has worked on organizing her second annual city-wide Earth Day event, educating local middle schools on the importance of environmental justice, and creating a statewide [Green Career and Education Fair](https://www.ourfutureoregon.org/2022-green-career-fair/). Erika hopes to continue connecting with the community and pursuing her passions.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Erika Leung.
