# Derica Theobald - Bronze Award

**School: Whitford Middle School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 41**  

Derica is a sixth grader at Whitford Middle School. She is a warm and kind-hearted person who, by nature, has a genuine desire to help others, especially those who are less fortunate than her. It is a rewarding experience for her when her efforts can make positive impacts in people's lives. She volunteers with school, sports clubs, and different community groups and charities. This year, Derica helped the Elks with their Christmas gift envelope decorations, and bought and sold items for the OCC Pioneer Square festival fundraising. She regularly helps the coaches with getting out and putting back equipment at the gymnastic studio she attends.

As a member of the non-profit [Letâ€™s Peer Up](https://www.letspeerup.org/), Derica helps advocate for neurodiverse people. She helped spread awareness of the issue at the City Council meetings and other events. Through different advocacy activities, Derica developed leadership, social and communication skills while transforming herself into an open-minded pre-teen. With the effort of LPU members including Derica, the City created the ADA Technical Advisory Committee, which will start at the beginning of 2020 to better serve people with physical and mental differences.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Derica Theobald.
