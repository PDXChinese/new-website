He has a good command of both spoken and written Chinese, as he has kept on a continuous study in the past years, listening to the story-telling of *The Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and *Journey to the West* is a treat for him. He has been learning to play the Chinese Bamboo flute since 1st grade, playing Bamboo flute helps him to better understand traditional Chinese culture. He is a dedicated swimmer, swimming for his club and the Westview Swim Team. In addition, he is a cadet in the Washington County Search and Rescue program. He believes volunteer work can bring a positive impact on his community, and he hopes to participate in more volunteer activities and take part in community events and services.
