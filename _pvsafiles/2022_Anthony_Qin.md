# Anthony Qin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 103**  

Anthony, a junior attending Westview High School, has demonstrated his passion for giving back to his community by volunteering for various organizations: [The Oregon Food Bank](https://www.oregonfoodbank.org/), OES, and [THPRD](http://www.thprd.org/). Through volunteering, he has been able to gain communication skills, as well as make a direct impact by giving back to his community. His volunteering experience can be highlighted by his time at the Oregon Episocal School (OES), where he learned how to effectively communicate with people from different backgrounds, solve problems, and take initiative in a large group setting. Additionally, his interest in STEM, more specifically, computer science, encouraged him to apply the leadership and organization skills that he picked up from his volunteering experiences to co-found two academic organizations: Westview Data Science and Westview ACSL. Both clubs aim to serve the Westview community by encouraging underprivileged students and girls to actively involve themselves in the realm of computer science and data science. As for free-time activities, Anthony enjoys working out and cuddling with his dog, Milton.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Anthony Qin.
