# Laura Qin (Silver Award)

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 77**  

Growing up in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, Laura was often sheltered from the adversity of reality. She spent her childhood primarily concerned with her academic and social well-being. However, Laura only fully recognized the extent of her privilege when she spent a couple weeks in the rural fringes of China, exposed to an alternate spectrum of struggles - grim struggles. On this trip, she realized vast public still lacked access to the healthcare. Moving forward, she started thinking of ways to give back to the less fortunate of her local community. When Laura entered high school, she started volunteering at the Cedar Mill Library every week, until she decided to direct her volunteering pursuits towards her interest in medicine. Over the summer, she obtained a volunteer position at Oregon Science and Health University (OHSU) in order to expand her knowledge about the medical field and directly help other people. Alongside volunteering, Laura is Co-Captain of the Westview Dance Team. She practices approximately 15-20 hrs every week, and dance has both physically and mentally challenged her. On the team, she has developed many valuable qualities like perseverance, respect, and humility. Lauraâ€™s passions have helped mold her character, benefiting both her and her community.
