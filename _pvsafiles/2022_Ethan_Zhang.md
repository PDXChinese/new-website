# Ethan (Yixiang) Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 105**  

Ethan is currently a 10th grader at Westview High School. During the current year, he volunteered in many areas, including cybersecurity. In previous years during the pandemic, he joined outreach efforts in order to give education to a wider audience on a broad range of topics. This year, he continued his efforts in volunteering.

Ethan has always been interested in the field of computer science ever since his introduction. In particular, he has been interested in cybersecurity. In recent years, cybersecurity has become a burgeoning field and topic in the world among most people. This year, he organized and hosted many sessions to educate people about a variety of cybersecurity topics. In the summer, he led various outreach and cooperation efforts with other fellow students in order to better people’s understanding of cybersecurity,  as well as doing a few presentations himself. This summer education program is four-week long with eight sessions that lasted two hours each. This helped instill basic foundations and knowledge of cybersecurity in many students, an asset that would surely greatly benefit them in the future.

Along with cybersecurity, he also participated in a diverse range of other activities. During the months previous to summer, he partook in many efforts to clean up and better the community landscape. During that period, he assisted with efforts such as tree planting and trash cleanup around Oregon, helping beautify the natural scenery in the local community.

2022 was the fallen ashes of 2020’s explosive disaster. While 2022 could have taken turns in wildly different directions, Ethan still snatched the opportunity to assist in efforts around his community by volunteering to contribute to the cause of the betterment of the conditions of those around him.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Zhang.
