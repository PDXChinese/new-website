# Noah Von Dem Bruch - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 103**  

Throughout the years of growing up, I’ve always been volunteering: from cleaning up at Tryon Creek State Park to packaging lunches at Meals on Wheels to sharing Chinese culture in Lan Su Chinese Garden. I view volunteering as a fun activity to provide a helping hand; yet in this past year, I’ve been able to perceive volunteering at a deeper level since I started to perform Wushu more frequently in many cultural events- I realize my performance bring happiness and inspiration to people of different ages and cultures, instilling a sense of wonder in children, indulgence from elders, and awakening of a new appreciation of  Wushu passion to all.

My involvement in helping to teach kids Wushu has also brought me immense joy and new understanding of how childrens’ skills and passion sprout from inspiration.

In all, volunteering has helped me find a new purpose to inspire in my own identity.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Noah Von Dem Bruch.
