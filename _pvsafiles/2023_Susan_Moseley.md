# Susan Moseley - Bronze Award

**School: St. Stephen's Episcopal School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 54**  

Susan is a boarding junior at St. Stephen's Episcopal School, and has worked to give back to the community. As an avid reader who has always loved going to libraries, Susan volunteered at the Hillsboro Public Library as a member of the Teen Cohort assisting in the many services the Hillsboro Public Library provides. Furthermore, Susan worked to help set up for the Chinese Friendship Association of Portland's 2023 中文夏令营, a non profit summer camp dedicated to giving children in the community a resource for learning Chinese. Continuing to serve Portland's Chinese community, Susan volunteered at Oregon Chinese Coalition's Chinese Conversation Corner at the Lan Su Chinese garden. Susan also volunteered at OMSI, grateful to have the opportunity to give back to the institutions that helped to grow her lasting love of service and learning. Susan's work has allowed her to both support the underserved and advocate for people in her community, and her volunteer work has improved Susan's communication skills and given her a greater perspective. Currently, she continues to serve others and advocate for social justice at her school as the leader of the Chinese Culture Club and a member of the Curriculum Advocacy Alliance and Multiracial Affinity Group.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Susan Moseley.
