Sophie Wang is a current sophomore attending the Beaverton Academy of Science and Engineering (BASE). She is the VP of Outreach for her HOSA chapter and co-founded her own Science Fair club. She is very passionate about exploring different STEM career initiatives, and strives to promote her love for science and healthcare within her community both in and out of the classroom.

Sophie has been volunteering at OMSI where she presents numerous science-related demos and curates her own educational videos. She also volunteered with Legacy Hospice in a direct medical environment, which allowed her to again contribute to the STEM community.

Sophie has provided service and resources towards supporting others through her volunteer work. She has also gained more knowledge through attending conferences such as the Global Health Leaders Conference at John Hopkins University and is a board member for healthcare nonprofits that have a mission to promote healthcare towards diverse and underrepresented communities.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophie Wang.
