# Jason Fu - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 262**  

Jason Fu is a junior at Sunset High School, and is an active member of many volunteering organizations. After growing increasingly concerned about the amount of extracurricular education younger students were receiving, he decided to take action. Under the YouthLink program, he taught Japanese, edited newsletters, led its website design, and managed its social media department. Furthermore, through various organizations such as the OCC Youth Ambassador Program and Sunset High School's Key Club, he continuously looked for other ways to benefit the pandemic-stricken community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jason Fu.
