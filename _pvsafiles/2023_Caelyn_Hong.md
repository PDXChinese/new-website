# Caelyn Hong - Silver Award

**School: Hope Chinese Charter School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 57**  

I’m 10 years old. I go to Hope Chinese Charter School. I participate in Volunteer work, including the Dragonfly yoyo team. I have taught Chinese yoyo to the students who are new, and also performed Chinese yoyo tricks. And every Sunday I go to the Hope Chinese Charter School and practice Chinese yoyo. Sometimes the yoyo team will participate in performances, and I would love to perform the yoyo tricks to other people.

I have been working hard on volunteering for the Oregon Chinese Coalition, and I find happiness in helping other people who are in need. I always try to give my best efforts to volunteer. For example, when it is summer break, I volunteer at Hope, I go there to entertain kids that go for summer camp. I’m really happy to see all the kids, eager to learn about this wonderful tradition. And try to play the Chinese yoyo. While persuading kids to participate in the Chinese yoyo activity. Everyday Thursday and Friday I have to wake up earlier than normal, and go to Hope school.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Caelyn Hong.
