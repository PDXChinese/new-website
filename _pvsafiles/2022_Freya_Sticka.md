# Freya Sticka - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 102**  

Freya is 15 years old, and in her Sophomore year at Sunset High School. She learned Mandarin as her first language and bonded with children of [Oregon Hope Chinese School](http://oregon-hope.org/) growing up by teaching Mandarin and English. She took the opportunity over the summer to [teach English to Chinese immigrants](https://pdxchinese.org/summer_esl_project_07092022/) and has been since then. She enjoys language and helping other people to study it as well in order to improve their ability to perceive the world. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Freya Sticka.
