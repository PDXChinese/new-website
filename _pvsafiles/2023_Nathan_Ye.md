# Nathan Ye - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 100.5**  

Nathan is a freshman at Westview High School. Ever since he was young, he was inspired by the community and developed a passion for STEM. Wanting to give back to the community, he volunteered as a teacher's assistant to mentor younger students in the field of mathematics and engineering.

Beyond his academic pursuits, Nathan is a dedicated competitive swimmer. Grateful for the unwavering support from his coaches, he reciprocated by coaching a group of kids with special needs, guiding them to remarkable success in their end-of-season swim meet.

Not confined to the pool, Nathan's commitment has extended further. He helped to raise funds to help build soccer fields for the underprivileged. Additionally, he volunteered to assist veterans with spinal cord injuries, amputations, multiple sclerosis, or other central neurological conditions to compete in wheelchair sports.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Nathan Ye.
