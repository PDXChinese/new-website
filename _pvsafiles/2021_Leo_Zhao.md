# Leo Zhao - Bronze Award

**School: Skyridge Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 52**  

Leo is an 8th grader at Skyridge Middle School who earned his volunteer hours from teaching others about Java, a popular programming language with many applicable areas and uses in the modern world. Teaching and educating other people about what he is interested is something that Leo has always wanted to do, and he was inspired to share his knowledge with others around him. Leo has also collaborated and worked with Renee Liu as an assistant teacher, preparing lesson material, teaching the classes and grading homeworks from the students. Over the summer, Leo was also assigned the task of editing and revising the Java curriculum for better clarity and comprehensiveness to enhance the quality of the teaching material. Leo hopes that all the students he has worked with have learned something that will help them in their own goals and projects in the future!

Throughout his experience, Leo has come to value the importance of good communication skills in both text and voice, and he hopes that he will always be learning and improving as he continues to teach and grow as a person. He is proud that he is able to serve and impact his community in a positive way, and is very thankful to everyone who has helped him along his journey to becoming a better person.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Leo Zhao.
