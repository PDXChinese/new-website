Tiantong is currently a junior in Oregon Episcopal School. She came as an international student boarding in OES since August 2021. In school, she actively participates in the school's community services, including offering language help and assisting the lower school teacher. After her family immigrated to America on March 2022, she transferred to a day student. Both her family and her are frequently engaged in the community. She joined the Jade Dance Team during this summer, joined most of the performances with the team, and now become one of the dancer leaders. She's also continuing on her online program, assisting younger kids in the community with their Chinese. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Emily Shang.
