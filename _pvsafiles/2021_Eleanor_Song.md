# Eleanor Song - Silver Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 79**  

Eleanor is a freshman at Sunset High School. In the past year, she has participated in various internships, tutoring programs, and other volunteer work. Wanting to work with people due to a lack of face-to-face interaction during the pandemic, she began tutoring elementary students in IXL English Language Arts and preparing them for the Math Kangaroo competition. She also helped with the writing, editing, and graphic design as well as being Writing Manager of the Youth-Link Newsletter. Alongside a friend, she learned more about local politics by being an OCC Youth Ambassador and attending Beaverton School District School Board meetings while writing synopses about them. Wanting to encourage political activity in minority groups, she did voter phone banking for the less politically active Chinese community in the Metro areas during the 2020 election. Despite not being old enough to vote, she hopes that her efforts helped ensure someone else's voice was counted. Worried during the Covid-19 vaccine distribution, she participated in a vaccine advocacy internship meant to promote the vaccine and reach more people through community work. All in all, she has learned a lot from the past year in terms of becoming more involved with the community. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Eleanor Song.
