# James Prasad - Bronze Award

**School: Lake Oswego Junior High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 51**  

Jimmy is an eighth grader at Lake Oswego Junior High School. Jimmy's journey of giving back began when he was just seven years old, and it has since blossomed into a remarkable commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of others.  At just 13 years old, he has become a shining example of kindness and civic responsibility.

One of Jimmy's favorite ways to give back is by volunteering at the Oregon food bank. He is always ready to help repack and organize food supplies.  His hands-on approach and cheerful attitude not only make the task at hand more enjoyable for everyone but also showcases his dedication to alleviating hunger in the community as well as throughout the state of Oregon.

Throughout the summer, Jimmy often volunteered in his hometown of Lake Oswego, only some of which are described here.  During the bustling weekends, Jimmy would arrive at 6:45 AM to help set up the Lake Oswego Farmers' Market. His enthusiasm for supporting local businesses was evident as he assisted  in setting up stalls and communal areas.  In the Library, he signed up children and families in the Summer Reading program to promote ongoing education and the love of reading.  Jimmy also volunteered at local City sponsored concerts, where he had the opportunity to assist in promoting community boosting events that showcase local talent and promote a sense of community spirit.

Whether he's helping to repack at the food bank or setting up the farmers' market, Jimmy is living proof that a kind heart and a willingness to help can truly make a lasting difference in the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to James Prasad.
