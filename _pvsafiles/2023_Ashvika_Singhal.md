# Ashvika Singhal - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 296**  

Hi! My name is Ashvika and I am a junior at Sunset High School in Portland. Throughout the year, I dedicated my time to making a positive impact by channeling my interests in science, speech & debate, and camping into meaningful volunteer work. I've been thrilled to provide younger kids in my community with the chance to explore these activities, encouraging them to discover their passions. I am excited to continue making an impact through my volunteering in the future!

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ashvika Singhal.
