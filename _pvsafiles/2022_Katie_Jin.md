# Katie Jin - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 105**  

Doing various volunteer activities this past year has been so fulfilling in so many aspects to Katie. It has allowed her to see new perspectives and engage in things that she enjoys while helping the community. Her most memorable experience is becoming close friends with students that she was a teacher's assistant. This allowed her to gain experience in teaching, allow her to spend time on a topic that she cared about, and build connections with others. Volunteering is something that Katie highly recommends to people of all ages because it brings not only benefits to the community as a whole, but in turn also brings endless amounts of benefits to you.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Katie Jin.
