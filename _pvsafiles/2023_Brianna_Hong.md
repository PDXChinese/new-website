# Brianna Hong - Silver Award

**School: Scholls Heights Elementary**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 52**  

I am in fifth grade at Scholls Heights Elementary.  I joined the PDX Dragonfly Yo-Yo Team and became a community aspirant in the past six months.  Participating in our Team's activities gave me a better understanding of helping others and serving society.  Although I have not been able to join more community service projects because of my age, I still feel happiness from the limited time I have spent at the community services, and appreciate the friendship, unity and mutual assistance between one another.  All of this makes me excited and allows me to experience the meaning of life.  Also, helping others by spreading joy and happiness around me.

Our team has performed at many events, especially the Chinese Festival in August at the Front Square. We showed our Chinese culture and spirit, spread our healthy lifestyle and we look forward to a bright future.  

In my daily life, I introduce our traditional culture and the Chinese language to my classmates and friends.  Hope Chinese Charter School teaches children Chinese Yo-Yo skills and the language, so that more people can understand Chinese culture.  

Although my life is very happy now, there are still many people who are famished, or do not have food to eat.  I started to volunteer at Oregon Food Bank, and I have realized that there are many more people who need help, and I became a visionary at the food bank.  

In the future, I want to continue to contribute to those who need help, so that more people can feel the beauty and happiness of life.  This experience is also the part of my growth process, and lets me become a more responsible person and appreciate what I have.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Brianna Hong.
