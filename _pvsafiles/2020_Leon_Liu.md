# Leon Liu - Bronze Award

**School: International School of Beaverton**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours:54**  

Leon Liu currently attends the International School of Beaverton as an 8th grader. He discovered volunteering in middle school. Starting with volunteering at the Oregon Food Bank, he learned how such a simple thing like straight labor can help so many people. Overall, volunteering has been a fun learning experience for Leon. Earlier this summer, he paired up with a couple friends and taught math to elementary schoolers on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 9-10am over the course of five weeks. The experience helped him appreciate his teachers more as well as build strong relationships with the students. He has also participated in a winter drive, accepting donations to keep people comfortable in the winter, including warm clothes and non-perishable foods. Leon loves helping people in need and is very grateful for the opportunities he has. Some of his hobbies include coding, piano, and soccer. In the future, he would like to study acting and medicine.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Leon Liu.
