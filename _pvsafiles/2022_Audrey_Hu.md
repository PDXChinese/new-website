This year, she was a dancer in the [Jade Dance Team](https://pdxchinese.org/youthdance/), where she learned and performed two Chinese cultural dances with the team at the [Chinese Festival](https://pdxchinese.org/chinesefestival/) of summer 2022. Last year, she volunteered at an event by the [Friends of Tualatin Refuge](https://friendsoftualatinrefuge.org/) to plant seeds in a wetland. She interviewed the Orox Leather Company of Chinatown for the [Youth Lens](https://pdxchinese.org/youthlens/) program and edited and uploaded an informational video on OCC YouTube account. She also put lots of effort editing Chinese Festival video parts. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Audrey Hu.
