# Roselyn Dai - Gold Award

**School: Lakeridge High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 258**  

Knowing that just a few hours of my afternoon can make an unimaginable difference for someone else is what motivates me to volunteer. My most significant volunteering position is as a Peer Crisis Intervention Specialist at YouthLine, a teen crisis support. On the lines, I talk with teens about anything from stress and anxiety to suicide. This volunteering position has strengthened my drive to continue doing anything in my power to support others since you never know who may be struggling but donâ€™t know how to reach out or are afraid to ask for help. I also held volunteering positions at OHSU Hospitals and Legacy Good Samaritan Medical center. Aside from volunteering, I have been a part of my school speech and debate team since Freshman year since I believe educating oneself on the social and civic issues in the world around us and learning how to make an impact with our voice is crucial towards fostering a generation of leaders that can continue to better our communities.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Erik Liang.
