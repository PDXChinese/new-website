# Monica Luo - Gold Award

**School: International School of Beaverton**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 103**  

Monica is a student at the International School of Beaverton that participates in many extracurricular activities. She has done many things to display her culture. This includes performing a traditional Chinese dance, ‘Flower With a Flute’, for Oregon Chinese Coalition’s Chinese Festival and for Beaverton Welcoming Week. She also helped give away Covid-19 test boxes while showing off and educating others on traditional Northeastern Chinese and Mongolian clothing for the OCC. She focuses on displaying and communicating to others about culture, but still participating in other smaller volunteering projects.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Monica Luo.
