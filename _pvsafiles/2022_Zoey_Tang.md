# Zoey Tang - Silver Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 80**  

Zoey is a 9th grader at Westview High School. In 2022, she founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization called [Puddletown Chess](https://puddletownchess.org/) to promote chess in K-12 players in local areas. She herself is an active chess player and holds the [Women International Master](https://www.chess.com/terms/woman-international-master-chess) title. Ever since pandemic began in 2019, scholastic chess tournaments, after school programs and other events have almost completely vanished. The number of scholastic chess players has plummeted. Zoey feels the urge to help change this situation. She actively helps K-12 students learn chess through Puddletown Chess by giving chess lessons, directing chess tournaments, and providing free game analysis. Puddletown Chess also teamed up with other similar organizations to increase the outreach online holding free seminars.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Zoey Tang.
