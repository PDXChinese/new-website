# Susan Moseley - Bronze Award

**School: St. Stephen's Episcopal School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 63**  

Susan is a sophomore at St. Stephen’s Episcopal School. Growing up surrounded by the Chinese American community, Susan found a deep cultural connection with those around her. To better understand this sense of community and spread this understanding to others, Susan joined in an informational project aiming to find the Chinese population in each county of Oregon. Furthermore, Susan not only volunteered at the [Lan Su Chinese Garden](https://lansugarden.org/things-to-do/ongoing-programs/chinese-conversation-table) in downtown Portland but also helped to [teach English to those in the greater Portland region](https://pdxchinese.org/summer_esl_project_07092022/) in order to help them find greater opportunities and connect with their communities. Wanting to further help, Susan volunteered at the [Oregon Food Bank](https://www.oregonfoodbank.org/) to provide necessities to those in Portland who might’ve not been able to obtain them alone, and helped with wetland restoration at the [Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/tualatin-river). Volunteering allowed Susan to give back to a community that supported her, gave her a greater perspective, and showed her that even a single person could make an impact if only they were willing to help. Currently, she continues to help others around her at school by working to advocate for social justice and cultural understanding as a member of the Multiracial Affinity Group and the vice president of her school’s Chinese Culture Club.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Susan Moseley.
