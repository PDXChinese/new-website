# Jenell Theobald - Silver Award

**School: International School of Beaverton**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 201**  

Jenell is a junior at International School of Beaverton. Driven by her personal experiences, Jenell started being a voice for disadvantaged groups back in elementary school. She is currently furthering her advocacy through serving on government committees. She was a member of the city's ADA Technical Advisory Committee, and currently is on the state's Youth Development Council as the youngest member and only high school student ever to serve on that council.

In the past year, Jenell has cooked for Transition Projects monthly. Shelter residents' compliments and smiles remind her that the many hours she puts into the work are well worth it. Meanwhile, she continues her longtime support for Camp Meadowood Springs, which is a special camp for kids with communication difficulties. She keeps doing fundraising for them, and also went to their annual Memorial Day weekend cleanups at its eastern Oregon campsite. She also continues her involvement with the design process of Lone Fir Cemetery Cultural Heritage Garden, which is a memorial of the forgotten railroad workers who help build our region's important infrastructure over a century ago.

Advocating for underserved groups is a long-term passion for Jenell. Her enthusiasm and commitment to service has inspired many, helping to make positive impacts to the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jenell Theobald.
