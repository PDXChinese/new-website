# Fiona Zou - Silver Award

**School: Camas High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 225**  

Fiona is a senior at Camas High School. She co-founded Beats of Bethany, a nonprofit organization that seeks to support and empower youth to serve their
community. Beats of Bethany hosts seasonal concerts at senior centers in the Oregon and Washington region and other community initiatives focused on helping individuals in need. To pursue her interest in the health field, she became a youth volunteer at Kaiser Permanente on top of her extensive involvement in other activities and organizations such as the Red Cross, Link Crew, Student Advisory Committee, Instructional Materials Committee, AAYLC, and manager of the boy's tennis team. Her volunteering experiences have allowed her to grow and become more intuitive, passionate, and determined. Besides her dedication to volunteering, Fiona plays piano and tennis competitively. In addition to her extensive volunteering, she has taken on a leadership role in organizing the first-ever city-wide Asian Culture Fair in downtown Camas. Fionaâ€™s dedication to service has allowed her to become a leader in her community and positively impact her community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Fiona Zou.
