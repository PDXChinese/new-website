Allison is currently a freshman at Lincoln High School. Allison volunteers with the goals to benefit her community through empowerment of marginalized groups.  She hopes that her efforts to celebrate people from marginalized communities, especially Chinese American women like herself, will bring positive impact those around her. Allison has been a part of the Oregon Chinese Coalition, the Youth and Women’s Development Organization, and the Multnomah County Youth Advisory Board. She is on the FTC robotics team, Overcharged, which regularly holds outreach events to inspire children to be involved in STEM. Allison is also the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Representative at her school’s class cabinet.

Following her involvement in the Oregon Chinese Coalition, aside from volunteering at the Lan Su Chinese Garden, Allison has become a dancer under their Jade Dance Team to promote Chinese culture in Portland through traditional Chinese dance performances. They have had performances for several cultural festivals and events to celebrate the beauty of diversity.

Allison has been a part of the Youth and Women’s Development Organization as well. She has focused on combating inequity towards Chinese American Women. Allison has worked with their Chinese Rose Princesses to plan and host a celebration event for Chinese New Year that included cultural presentations and performances. As a part of this organization, Allison has also been able to volunteer internationally for Miss Universe Canada 2023.

Her work in racial advocacy has enabled herself to run for and achieve the position of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Representative in Lincoln High School’s freshmen student council. For this following year, Allison plans to improve the representation and promotion of affinity groups at her school.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Allison Hu.
