# Anthony Qin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 65**  

Anthony is a sophomore at Westview High School. He enjoys learning about computer science and playing basketball in his spare time. Throughout the year 2021, he has volunteered to teach algebra, python, and ACSL classes to elementary and middle schoolers through Youth-Link. He especially enjoyed teaching ACSL, a competition in which he has participated in for the past 4 years, because he wanted to spark his studentsâ€™ interest in computer science in a fun and competitive way. He saw himself in every one of his students and worked hard to cater to their learning needs. Throughout his volunteering, Anthony has gained valuable communication and leadership skills and hopes that his students continue to find something that they are truly passionate about. Having grown up in a family of software engineers, Anthony was heavily influenced by his parents, prompting him to start learning computer science at a young age. This early exposure to the computer science field gradually made him very interested in computer programming. In addition to volunteering, Anthony enjoys playing basketball and going to the gym regularly. Playing basketball and volunteering at Youth-Link helped him to become a more resilient and persevering young man.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Anthony Qin.
