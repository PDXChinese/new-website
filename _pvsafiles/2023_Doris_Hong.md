# Doris Hong - Gold Award

**School: Hope Chinese Charter School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 112**  

I am currently a 7th grader at Hope Chinese Charter School. Aside from my studies and hobbies, volunteering has become a passion that I wholeheartedly invest my time and efforts into. Joining the Phoenix Hanfu Team and the Dragonfly Yoyo Team at the Oregon Chinese Coalition has shown me the joy of being a volunteer and spreading happiness to others.

During the summer, I volunteered at Hope Chinese Charter School, where I taught many students how to play the Chinese yoyo and shared insights into Chinese traditional culture. I always strive to give my best in everything I do, and volunteering has become a favorite activity for me outside of school. I dedicate a significant amount of time to helping others and promoting awareness of our beautiful Chinese culture.

Some of the volunteer activities I have been involved in include the annual Chinese Festival celebration at Pioneer Courthouse Square, interviews with Su Zhou artists, tea parties with John, photography sessions at Lan Su Chinese Garden downtown, performances at the Beaverton Night Market, and numerous rehearsals and practices at Hope Chinese Charter School.

Engaging in various volunteering opportunities has allowed me to understand the importance of helping others and experiencing the happiness that comes from making people smile. I am grateful for the valuable experiences gained through these activities, which I believe will greatly contribute to my future endeavors in serving the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Doris Hong.
