# Sophia You - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 260**  

Sophia is a junior at Sunset High School. She's always been passionate about giving back to her community, which is why she started volunteering at Cedar Mill Community Library - first as a regular media circulation volunteer, and later as a graphic designer for the library's Youth Services department. She has designed badges and banners for reading challenges and is always excited to combine creativity with service. Additionally, Sophia also loves playing the piano for visitors at Doernbecher's Children's Hospital and chatting with young inpatients. In her free time, she loves listening to music, drawing, reading, and cooking.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophia You.
