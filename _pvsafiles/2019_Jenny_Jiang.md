# Jenny H Jiang - Silver Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 78**  

Jenny is a sophomore at Sunset High School and enjoys volunteering with people from diverse age groups. Starting last year, she has been tutoring science to fifth graders interactively and artistically. This approach sheds new light on learning science, allowing the younger generation to realize that science is not limited to reading lifeless articles. By making a DNA strand composed of candy and doing a strawberry dissection with fifth graders, Jenny educates fifth graders science in a fun and creative way. Jenny also volunteers with THPRD, where she uses her artistic abilities to give face paint to children at community events. She helps out at the Portland’s Children’s Museum by interacting with the kids at the art studios and reading books to them during story times. This past fall, Jenny co-founded a community service organization at her school called Helping Hands. Her club volunteers with two vulnerable age groups that depend on medical assistance: children suffering from pediatric cancer and seniors assisted in memory care. Jenny has encouraged a classroom full of caring high schoolers to volunteer with these groups in medical aid. By volunteering with multiple age groups in varying situations, Jenny has helped people in different life stages, while transforming herself into a more selfless and open-minded high schooler.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jenny Jiang.
