Gwyneth is a junior at Lincoln High School. She is a co-president of FlockFeast, a partnership program between her school and Clay Street Table with the mission of tackling food insecurity. There, Gwyneth serves members of the houseless community and a diverse set of cultural groups by preparing food alongside serving meals for houseless and senior citizens. She also food sources for [Clay Street Table](https://claystreettable.org/), ensuring that the food provided is both culturally appropriate and in good condition. Additionally, Gwyneth volunteers at the [Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center](https://www.legacyhealth.org/doctors-and-locations/hospitals/legacy-good-samaritan-medical-center) to bring together her passions for medicine and service. Her most valued experiences are visiting the patients and seeing the direct impact her volunteering has made. Promoting civic engagement and education is an important cause for Gwyneth. She mentors her school's constitution team to prepare them for the We The People competition with her knowledge of the history, principles, and constitution of the United States. She also volunteers with [Mission: Citizen](https://missioncitizen.org/) to prepare immigrants for the U.S. naturalization test, encouraging civic competence and responsibility. Gwyneth loves seeing the positive impact her work has made on the community and strives to inspire others to take action as well.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Gwyneth Bao.
