# Ethan Qin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 52.75**  

Ethan, a junior at Westview High School, has always been inclined to serve his community. Throughout the past year, Ethan has worked hard volunteering at [THPRD](http://www.thprd.org/), the [food bank](https://www.oregonfoodbank.org/), and OCC election support activities before this yearâ€™s midterm election. Also, he is passionate about python programming, leading him to start up two clubs dedicated to help students at his school get involved with programming, as well as volunteering with teaching young kids computer science during his sophomore year. During his time volunteering with THPRD, he gained a significant amount of leadership, communication, and teamwork skills as he had to lead children in activities and communicate with the other leaders. These activities helped him build a strong sense of teamwork, as he had to make sure he was on the same pace with the leaders. He hopes to be able apply these skills in his academic pursuits in the future as well. During his volunteering with the OCC election support team, he realized how little Asian Americans were involved in politics, as they historically have had the lowest voting rates out of any ethnicity. He hopes his current and future work with the OCC will be able to improve these statistics, as he believes that Asians together should be more involved with the community and have a louder voice when it comes to politics. In his free time, Ethan enjoys going to the gym and hanging out with his friends. He hopes his future ventures in and out of school will have a big impact on many communities.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Qin.
