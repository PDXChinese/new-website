# Raymond Lee - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 56.5**  

Raymond is a Westview High School sophomore and has always needed to give back to his community.  Over the past year or so he has been hard at work volunteering for many different agencies to give back to his community: the Oregon Food Bank, TRNWR, and Xstream Learning Center. Through all these programs he has learned a lot and has also refined lots of his skills in communication as well as learning valuable skills in teamwork. His time at Oregon Food Bank and TRNWR was spent bettering his community while refining his skills. This can be even better highlighted during his time with Xstream Learning Center where he was pushed out of his comfort zone as he had to work as a TA teaching kids often as young as 6 about science and engineering principles. His passions include playing his violin, playing chess, riding his bike, and swimming.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Raymond Lee.
