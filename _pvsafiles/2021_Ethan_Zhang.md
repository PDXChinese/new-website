# Ethan Zhang - Silver Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 78**  

Ethan is currently a 9th grade student at Westview High School. This year he has volunteered in many fields, similar to last year. During the pandemic, people were worried about missing out on education. Ethan joined youth-link with many other volunteers in order to help out. This year, he continued volunteering with more hours.

Ethan has always liked computer science. One part of computer science he likes more than the others is cybersecurity which is a major concern as many things have moved onto online media. This year, he has hosted multiple sessions and helped students in learning cybersecurity. In summer. he volunteered as a TA in an online week-long CyberPatriot cybersecurity summer camp hosted by Mathletics. He has also initiated outreach sessions with Youth Cyber Defender to reach students and communities that are new to cybersecurity.

In addition to cybersecurity above, he has volunteered for teaching math to younger students. Parents have sent their motivated children to outside of school education programs in concern that online schooling might not be enough for extremely important subjects like math. Ethan this year tutored some younger students to prepare for Math Kangaroo.

Along with math, chess has also been a long-time interest of his. This year, Ethan teamed up with some high school chess players to help teach students chess via weekly chess games and analysis in summer. This helped the students stay in touch with each other and play fun games.

2021 was an unfortunate continuation of the year 2020, a year that changed everyone. It also gave Ethan an opportunity to continue volunteer work in order to give back to people who gave so much to him.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Zhang.
