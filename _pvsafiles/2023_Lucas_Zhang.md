# Lucas (Haoxiang) Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 117**  

Lucas is an eighth grader currently at Catlin Gabel Middle School with a special interest in history. He enjoys fencing, skiing, history, and a variety of other topics, subjects, and activities.

Lucas created a history club in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic started to keep students isolated at home. He realized he could provide opportunities for students to interact with each other by leading discussions on interesting history topics. He would spend many hours a week and create a presentation to share with other curious peers. After receiving very positive feedback, he continued to hold these history sessions for the following summers, including the year of 2023. These meetings generally occur twice a week and discuss a single topic over several sessions.
Other than his history club, Lucas has spent a large amount of time preserving historical newspapers made for and by Chinese community in Portland, OR. He also spent many hours preparing and serving food for the more needy peoples of our community at the Clark Center. He has also participated in a myriad of other activities (e.g. a winter drive, encouraging voting, etc.)

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Lucas Zhang.
