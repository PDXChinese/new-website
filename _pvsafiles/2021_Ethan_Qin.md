# Ethan Qin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 65**  

Ethan is a sophomore at Westview High School. He enjoys learning about Python programming and playing basketball in his spare time. During his freshman and sophomore years, he taught many classes for 2nd to 8th graders, with topics ranging from Python, algebra, and ACSL through Youth-Link. He has used his 4 years of experience in various ACSL competitions to teach kids the topics that would be covered in future competitions. He also helps to teach kids the fundamentals of coding. Throughout volunteering for Youth-Link, Ethan has gained a wide range of leadership, communication, and teamwork skills, and hopes his teaching can affect his students in ways that might make them interested to do work in the stem field in the future. Having grown up in a family of software engineers, Ethan was heavily influenced by his parents, prompting him to start learning computer science at a young age. This early exposure to the computer science field gradually made him very interested in computer programming. In addition to volunteering, Ethan enjoys playing basketball and going to the gym regularly. Basketball and his volunteering experience at Youth-Link have helped to shape him into becoming a resilient and hard-working young man.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Qin.
