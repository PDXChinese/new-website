Helen is currently a junior at Sunset High School, where she holds multiple leadership positions in clubs like Key Club and National Honor Society. As the Primary Chair for National Honor Society, she organizes events aimed at bridging the gap between younger students and high schoolers, fostering a stronger bond between generations. She is also a captain and outreach lead of FTC robotics team Overcharged, organizing over 40 outreaches to inspire students to participate in STEM all throughout Oregon, bringing STEM to under-represented communities and providing a platform for industry professionals to share their knowledge with the community. Outside of robotics, Helen also helps lead the Youth Lens Project, aiming to preserve the oral history of Chinese-Americans in the Portland area by interviewing and sharing their valuable stories online. 

In her free time, Helen enjoys playing racquetball and hanging out with her cat.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Helen Wang.
