Claire is a current sophomore at Jesuit High School. Ever since her involvement in dancing at Jesuit's multicultural assembly, she has discovered a passion for traditional Chinese dance and community leadership. Since then, she started the [Jade Dance Team](https://pdxchinese.org/youthdance/) this year in partnership with [Oregon Chinese Coalition](https://pdxchinese.org/). Founding the Jade Dance Team has brought her so much joy, from meeting new dancers, learning new dances alongside her friends, and serving the community. They have truly created their own community of empowered Chinese youth who express their passion for culture and dance and celebrate our shared heritage with our community. Within the Jade Dance Team, she manages the leadership team, connects with the communities they perform for, and teach dance for their team of 20 dancers. In addition to performing twice with the Jade Dance Team at the 2022 [Chinese Festival](https://pdxchinese.org/chinesefestival/), she also emceed for the event. It was an empowering experience to speak on behalf of the Chinese community and celebrate diversity in our Portland community.

She has also served her local figure skating community through the [Carousel Sherwood Figure Skating Club Junior Board](https://www.carouselsherwoodfsc.org/junior-board). As the current Vice President and former Treasurer, she organized events that brought the figure skating community together including their annual Christmas Food Drive, Friendship Games, Halloween Party, and fundraisers such as the Car Wash. She love giving back to a community that she has grown up in and that has given so much to her. As a leader, she aims to inspire young skaters to lead and serve their skating community and further discover their passion for skating.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Claire Cao.
