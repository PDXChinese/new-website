# Qinglu Xu - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 113**  

I am currently 15 years old, and attending 10th grade at the Lake Oswego High School. In seventh grade, my friends and I began brainstorming an idea for a nonprofit organization that would benefit those who are in need of but don't have access to eye services. I wear my glasses daily, and I know how important it is to have good eye services and care. Thus, a few months later, my friends and I created Vision Envoy, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness and funds to provide eye services to those in need. In these past years, we have come so far in our journey, got to meet so many new friends, and provided service to those in our community. We have now become a branch of the Lake Oswego Lions Club, bringing new ideas and our own goals into the community. Through this organization, I was able to complete 100+ hours of service in the past year, focusing on different ways of fundraising, as well as the expansion of Chinese cultural knowledge. Outside of volunteering with my community, I enjoy playing tennis, spending time with friends and family, playing piano, and learning about the medical field and its infinite potential. I am currently enrolled in AP biology and chemistry, hoping to gain more knowledge in these studies to further help me understand the medical field and its related studies. Throughout these volunteer hours, I have come to love the members of my community and helping out one another. Additionally, I've also enjoyed learning about different eye diseases and how they are treated. I hope to pursue a career in the medical field in the future and continue to provide service to members of my community in many different ways.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Qinglu Xu.
