# Jenell Theobald - Gold Award

**School: Whitford Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 139**  

Jenell is a seventh grade Summa student at Whitford Middle School. While she has done various volunteer projects with different groups, her passion for volunteerism is focused on helping neurodiverse kids, such as those who are introverted or have social challenges. She started volunteering by helping Camp Meadowood Springs, a special camp supported by Oregon Elks for children with communication challenges. Jenell helped get the camp flyer posted in multiple school districts. She also created a Wikipedia article to help promote the camp. Feeling that so many neurodiverse kids around us desperately need reaching hands, Jenell started a nonprofit organization called [Let’s Peer Up](https://www.letspeerup.org/). Let’s Peer Up is dedicated to helping neurodiverse kids make friends. Jenell promoted LPU at the Oregon Elks’ State Convention and the Pioneer Square Chinese Festival. The Beaverton School District has featured LPU twice. ([https://www.smore.com/rmwes](https://www.smore.com/rmwes), [https://www.smore.com/ajds6](https://www.smore.com/ajds6)). As members of the first student-run project selected by PSU’s Capstone Program, Jenell and her teammates are working closely with a panel of 10 students from PSU Business School in order to build a lasting structure for LPU. She and her team are currently linking up with individuals who have a similar passion to build the organization together.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jenell Theobald.
