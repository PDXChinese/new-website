# Arianna Hong - Silver Award

**School: Scholls Heights Elementary**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 52**  

I am a 5th grade student in Scholls Heights Elementary. Being kind, patient, and able to do what I can to help others are my goals. During May this year, I was lucky enough to be part of the PDX Dragonfly Yo-Yo Team. This gave me an opportunity to become a volunteer. Our Team members help and encourage each other and contribute our strength to the community service together. We make more people willing to join our team through performances, and let more people know about our Chinese culture. We performed at the Youth Conference, El Sol Festival and Chinese Festival events. One of the most important is the Chinese Festival, in addition to the performance of the day, my sister and I kept on until the end of the activity, introducing our Yo-Yo, Chinese language, our traditional culture and our peace-loving will to people who like our Chinese culture.

During summer vacation, we also became volunteers of Hope Chinese Charter School, explaining Chinese Yo-Yo skills to children who like Chinese culture.

I'm also a volunteer at the Oregon Food Bank. I'm doing my part to make sure that people don't go hungry.

In order to make our community better and residents healthier, I am willing to contribute my own strength. I'm looking forward to spread more of the Chinese culture to ones who are interested.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Arianna Hong.
