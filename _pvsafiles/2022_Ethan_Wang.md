# Ethan Wang - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 118**  

Ethan is a sophomore at Westview High School. After interacting with seniors for the first time at the [Clay Street Table](https://claystreettable.org/) food pantry as well as seeing the effects of the pandemic on the elderly and their ability to obtain essential needs from stores, he sought to be a part of the solution.

Fortunately one of his school friends had founded an organization, [PDX Concierge](https://www.pdxdeliver.com/), which aimed to provide a delivery service for those affected by the pandemic. After doing countless deliveries over the summer, Ethan and a friend inherited the role of Co-Presidents of the organization and has ever since managed the task of collecting and completing orders, interacting with the customers, and seeking to gain more volunteers. Currently he is working towards forming partnerships between food banks across Portland to provide a delivery service for those who are unable to travel to food pantries.

Additionally, Ethan worked with his friend over the summer to present a free curriculum educating the youth about basic cybersecurity principals. Together they developed multiple interactive and compelling lesson plans and taught at different BSD run summer programs.

From these experiences Ethan has learned how despite the hardships and setbacks faced along the way, the reward of seeing the gratitude people show is worth it in the end. He continues to provide service for his local community, and hopes to educate and aid in the development of the next generation.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Wang.
