# Austin Yan - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 107**  

Austin is a Junior at Lincoln High School. Over the summer he attended a healthcare and medicine camp in Washington DC and developed an interest in medicine. Wanting to further explore my interest, he tried looking to join clubs in my school related to medicine, but he could not find any. Knowing that many of his friends and peers at school also had a similar interest in medicine, they decided to work together and create a health and medicine club at Lincoln. Their mission is to nurture the growth of students interested in the medical field. They bring in medical professionals as guest speakers to talk about their experiences, organize field trips to clinics in the local area, and compete in [HOSA](https://hosa.org/)'s state, and hopefully international, events.

As a bilingual Chinese American, he has the unique opportunity to connect the two cultures together. This prompted him to work as an English teacher for a recently immigrated student. They work together to improve his vocabulary and communication.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Austin Yan.
