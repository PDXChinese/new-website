# Muen Teng - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 110**  

Muen is currently a Junior at Lake Oswego High School. After starting to learn the piano at the age of 4, she aspired to share her music with the community. When she was 9 years old, she performed piano in the Children’s Hospital every weekend for a whole year. At the start of her sophomore year, she joined Songs for Seniors Club, a club that organizes music players to play music to seniors living in the retirement centers. She has been performing piano with Songs for Seniors biweekly since then. After performing, she also enjoys talking with the seniors, and listening to their story and their special relationships with music.

Muen also has strong skills in Math and Physics and she aspires to use her strengths to give back to her community. As an experienced math-lover, she tutored a younger student doing AMC 8, solving problems and sharing ideas with him. She also finished AP Physics in her sophomore year, so to help others, she served as an on-demand tutor, helping students to organize their newly-learned physics concepts and solve homework problems.

Aside from performing and tutoring, she also helps the seniors with technology. Some of her “students” are as old as 92 years old, and she goes through the most basic things such as turning on and off a computer with them with a lot of passion. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Muen Teng.
