# Fiona Zou - Gold Award

**School: Camas High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 169**  

Fiona was a freshman at the International School of Beaverton before moving to Camas, Washington in the fall. She is now a sophomore at Camas Highschool. Fiona has a passionate interest in art and music, and she co-founded a nonprofit organization called Beats of Bethany that seeks to support and empower youth who share the same passion in art and music to serve their community. Beats of Bethany hosts seasonal concerts at senior centers in the Oregon and Washington region and provides free art and music workshops to the underserved youth in low-income communities in the Portland metro area. Being able to work with students from economically challenged backgrounds has exposed Fiona to people from very different backgrounds and shed light on her own privilege. Fiona cherishes her volunteering experiences because they allow her to help those who are less fortunate than her. Her volunteering experiences have allowed her to grow and become a more intuitive, passionate, and determined person. Fiona is continuing to gain more experience and expand her organization's reach. For example, Fiona led Beats of Bethany to collaborate with the Oregon Chinese Coalition(OCC) to serve the local Chinese community. Besides her dedication to volunteering, Fiona spends her time being an avid singer in the Portland Symphonic GirlChoir, playing piano, and playing tennis competitively. Fiona yearns to bring awareness to the underprivileged youth and to connect people through music and art.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Fiona Zou.
