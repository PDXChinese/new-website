# Derica Theobald - Gold Award

**School: French American International School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 94**  

Derica is a 4th grade student at the French American International School. She is a very kind young lady who always notices the needs of those around her. Her willingness to help others is highly praised by everyone who knows her. She volunteers with school, choir, and different community groups and charities. She spent one whole week during the summer with kids from the deep mountains of Guizhou, so she appreciates what she has and is willing to share with those who are not as fortunate. As a younger sister, Derica gladly assists her older sister Jenell in her nonprofit Letâ€™s Peer Up, helping neurodiverse children, including spending Memorial Day weekend helping to clean up Camp Meadowood Springs, a summer camp for kids with communication challenges.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Derica Theobald.
