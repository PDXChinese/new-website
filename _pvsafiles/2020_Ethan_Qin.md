# Ethan Qin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 61**  

Growing up in a family with three children, Ethan learned to love his sister and twin brother from a very young age. As he started to attend pre-schools, he began to extend his kindness and love to his communities he was involved in. He had dreamed to become professional athletics during his elementary school years and spent most of his time playing all kinds of sports. At the beginning of his middle school, he started to learn Python programming at weekends and mastered a lot of computer science knowledge. Ethan became very interested in programming and was determined to become a professional programmer in the future. He tried to balance between schoolwork and playing basketball in his final year at middle school. However, the covid-19 pandemic suddenly changed everything with schools closing in March. Youth-link, a non-profit organization, responded to this sudden change by immediately organizing kids to do online learning from each other. Ethan decided to join Youth-link and share his computer and math knowledge with community kids since he also benefited from some college students’ talks at OCC’s Round Table conference and would like to contribute to his community as well. During his ten-weeks’ teaching at Youth-link, he helped a lot of kids to learn and get connected with each other online during the special quarantine period. In addition to Youth-link volunteer work, Ethan also helped at Oregon Foodbank and OCC’s Winter Drive last year. Ethan joined his high school Key Club and would like to participate more in community services. As a big fan of sports, he will help more under-privileged kids to play sports after covid-19 pandemic is over.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Qin.
