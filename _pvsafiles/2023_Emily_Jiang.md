Emily is a current freshman at Camas High School. Her passion for dance sprouted at the age of four, where she started her training in classical ballet. Through the years, she's learned various different styles of dance such as contemporary, traditional Chinese, jazz and hip hop. Through these art forms, she proudly promotes cultural diversity within and beyond the community with International Performing Arts. She has performed several times throughout the year and dedicates many hours to making sure they run smoothly.

Emily also joined the Jade Dance Team this year. She's performed with them at the Sherwood High School Culture Night, Riverdale High School Culture Show, Worldbeat Festival, Chinese Festival, and the Beaverton Night Market showcasing beautiful dances and promoting cultural exchanges. She later became a dance leader and enjoys being able to help and teach dancers. Through the Jade Dance Team, Emily has found much joy in serving the community and dancing with her friends.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Emily Jiang.
