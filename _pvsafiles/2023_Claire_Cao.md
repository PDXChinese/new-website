Claire founded the Jade Dance Team as a freshman, and since then the [Jade Dance Team](https://pdxchinese.org/youthdance/) has performed at over 20 cultural events, bringing Chinese culture and dance to the local community. With over 20 members from different schools, the Jade Dance Team brings together Chinese youth to celebrate and cherish Chinese culture in community. On the Jade Dance Team, Claire manages the leadership team, teaches dances, and connects with the greater community. In addition to performing, Claire served as an emcee for the Portland [Chinese Festival](https://pdxchinese.org/chinesefestival/) in 2022 and 2023. Through the Jade Dance Team, Claire continues to build community and celebrate Chinese culture through Chinese dance.

This summer, Claire began volunteering at [Blanchet House](https://blanchethouse.org/), a local food shelter located in Chinatown serving free meals. As a student ambassador, Claire helps with community outreach, organizes student projects, participates in donation events, and regularly volunteers with Blanchet House. Claire is grateful that her service to Blanchet House allows her to directly serve people in her community and create a tangible difference.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Claire Cao.
