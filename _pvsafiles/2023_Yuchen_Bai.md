Yuchen is a current sophomore at Westview High School. She is an active member of the Westview Key Club, Distributive Education Clubs of America, and the Science National Honor Society. Yuchen has always been passionate about running, science, photography, and Chinese culture. Over the past two summers, she has volunteered as a captain at Portland Chinese Evangelical Church and as a member of CEC Youth. She was the leader in Bible study and fun activities for Chinese American children from ages 5 to 12 during the one-week-long summer camps, providing them with a loving community to become a part of and supporting them in becoming confident and firmly rooted in their faith. With sports fascinating her and promoting a balanced life, Yuchen spent her first season on Westview's track and field and cross-country JV teams. She helps organize state qualifiers and competitions, team bonding events, food drives, and fundraisers. Additionally, Yuchen is a part of the Parkrun USA where she volunteers as a photographer every Saturday morning. Parkruns are events held every Saturday in 20 countries all around the world, organized by amazing, dedicated local volunteers. They aim to bring as many people as possible together to become part of a real local community through Parkrun events: weekly, free, for everyone.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Yuchen Bai.
