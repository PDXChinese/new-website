Jayden is a junior at Sunset High School. He discovered his love for debate after going to a summer camp in middle school. Ever since Jayden has strived to help others gain a better understanding of the world and develop public speaking skills through debate. He finds volunteering gratifying because it allows him to mentor others in the things he cares about. He especially enjoys teaching debate to students at Tumwater Middle School, but he also serves as a mentor within the Sunset Speech and Debate club. Jayden also engages with the community through his participation in the AAYLC (Asian American Youth Leadership Conference). Finally, Jayden serves as a leader for Sunset Cares. This is an organization at Sunset High School that helps children entering and leaving the foster care system. Jayden helps organize fundraisers and donations for the club, which is partnered with Every Child PDX. Outside of volunteering, Jayden enjoys hiking and reading.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jayden Huang.
