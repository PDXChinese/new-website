Tina is a freshman at the International School of Beaverton. Working with others to help the community has been a great experience in the past years. By working with fellow students, Tina can enjoy doing the activities that interest her while also giving to the community. By volunteering and working with younger students, she has found love in teaching and mentoring. She hopes to gain experience by volunteering simultaneously learning and building her character. Giving back to the community is especially important to her as it can benefit others and positively impact their lives. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Mingxuan Xu.
