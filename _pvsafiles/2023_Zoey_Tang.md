# Zoey Tang - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 181**  

Zoey is a sophomore at Westview High School. She is the founder and president of [Puddletown Chess](https://puddletownchess.org/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The goal of Puddletown Chess is to build a fun and collaborative community for youth chess players around Oregon. She and her collaborators held various chess events in the past year including weekly training programs, free monthly webinar, and monthly scholastic tournaments. More than five hundred chess players have taken part in these events, with the cumulative attendance over the past year reaching almost 1,500. Puddletown Chess made nearly $10,000 monetary donation to the local chess community in the previous year. Zoey has been paying special attention to chess players from underrepresented and underprivileged backgrounds, ensuring they derive the greatest benefit from both the events and donation.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Zoey Tang.
