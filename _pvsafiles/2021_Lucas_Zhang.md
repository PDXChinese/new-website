# Lucas Zhang - Silver Award

**School: Stoller Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 78**  

Lucas is a 6th Grader at Stoller Middle School who loves to interact with other kids and imbue a joy of history. Additionally, Lucas enjoys cyber security, fencing, skiing, tennis, and other fun and enjoyable activities.

Starting the summer of 2020, Lucas created a history club where he would spend 5-6 hours studying a topic and creating a presentation. Then he would lead a discussion about that specific topic in history during the bi-weekly meeting. At the club meet, there were about 10 students on average for every meeting. After the summer, he realized that the club was enjoyable to all parties involved and decided to continue during the school year with more or less the same schedule. The only difference was that in the weeks between, there would also be a meeting where the congregation went over History Bee question sets. This weekly club meet also provided an opportunity for students to connect together during the pandemic.

Lucas really enjoys history as he believes it can provide many intriguing stories, and it allows us to look back at the story of the world. Though other people may like history for other and differing reasons, he believes anybody can have a joy and love of history.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Lucas Zhang.
