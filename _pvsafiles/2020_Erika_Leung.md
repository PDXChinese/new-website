# Erika Leung - Silver Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 98**  

Erika Leung is a freshman at Lincoln High School. She is passionate about using her voice and art, and has been using those skills to give back to her community. She is a Youth Ambassador with where she spectated and analyzed community meetings from establishments like Portland Public Schools and Portland City Council in her perspective of a young citizen. She values this work because it bridges an intergenerational gap between her and her community.

She has also been involved with Oregon My School Votes's social media campaign, where she designed dozens of outreach posts to motivate the youth voter turnout. She believes education inspires others to use their voice and turn their beliefs into real action, especially in a time where issues in the world have left many feeling powerless. These experiences have only motivated her to continue her mission of doing what she can to improve the world around her.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Erika Leung.
