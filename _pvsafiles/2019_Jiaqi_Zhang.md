# Jiaqi Jackie Zhang - Silver Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 89**  

During the winter break of 6th grade, Jackie went on a trip back to China to visit her grandparents. Shortly after she returned from her visit, Jackie found out that her grandpa had passed away due to cancer, filling her with great regret of not spending more time with him. This made her realize how vital it is to build a strong relationship with one’s grandparents and seniors in general. In an effort to help the senior community, Jackie started to volunteer at a local senior living facility called Laurel Parc, and have been going there to interact with the residents every Sunday for over 3 years. The beginning of her volunteering journey was rough: it felt like a tedious job that had to be completed. However, after experiencing the joy of seeing the smiling and content faces of the people she has helped, and hearing stories of how her various activities made the senior’s lives much more entertaining, Jackie started to become eager to volunteer at Laurel Parc. Although it is difficult to continuously volunteer, she persevered and started to actively seek other volunteering opportunities, always focusing on the goal of helping less recognized communities. From raising money for children in the foster care system, to helping MC a Chinese festival to spread her culture, to organizing a small group to host fun activities for seniors at Laurel Parc, Jackie’s extensive volunteering has made a positive impact in many people’s lives.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jiaqi Zhang.
