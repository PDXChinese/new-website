# Zong Qu - Bronze Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 50**  

I am a seventh-grade student at Catlin Gabel. I've done various volunteering projects, but most are to help people in need. I volunteer at my school, church and OCC and community groups in need and charities. My first volunteering opportunity was on December 20th where I got to help throw a Christmas party for foster children to spend time with their biological parents for the holidays where I served food and drinks for people. I spend my time giving back to people in need and for events such as the Winter Drive or my school's event like Open House.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Zong Qu.
