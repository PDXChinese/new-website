# Derica Theobald - Gold Award

**School: Whitford Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 170**  

Derica is an eighth grade SUMMA student at Whitford Middle School. She is naturally talented with the skills to easily engage people and thoroughly understand them, and she always tries earnestly to assist those in need.


Derica started serious involvement in volunteer activities in the third grade. Although she has volunteered with many different charities, her main focus has always been celebrating diversity and to those less recognized groups. She went to eastern Oregon over Memorial Day weekend to help prepare for a special camp to kids with communication challenges. She has spent many hours each month cooking for the Transition Projects shelter. Derica believes it is important to promote diverse cultures. She has served at many cultural events, such as PSU Farmers Market, Lansu Garden, Portland Downtown Parade, and THPRD Cultural Day.

Derica's genuine desire to help others has influenced those around her. Her efforts have made positive impacts to the local community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Derica Theobald.
