Elise is a senior at Lincoln High School. She currently serves as the Co-Director of Communications of Mission: Citizen, a student-led nonprofit providing free citizenship classes to help immigrants pass the naturalization exam. To spread awareness about Mission: Citizen’s cause, she outreaches through local events and social media, while connecting with prior students to understand and share their naturalization stories. In addition, Elise expresses her passion for medicine and helping others at the Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center and the Kaiser Permanente Urgent Care Clinic, where she assists patients and transports clinical equipment. Volunteering in these medical settings has enriched her interest in the field. She is also the co-president of her school’s Red Cross Club and aims to serve and educate others by organizing numerous blood drives and educational campaigns over the past few years. Through these experiences, she has formed valuable connections and aspires to continue making a widespread impact in her community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Elise Yu.
