# Claudia Zhuge - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 127.75**  

Claudia is currently a Freshman at Sunset High School. She joined the Jade Dance Team in July 2022 and has performed with the team multiple times to improve the awareness of the diversity of different cultures in the community. She also has volunteered at Bonny Slope Elementary School to help with events. She went to the Oregon Food Bank to repackage food. She prepared and cooked food for the members of the houseless community at The Clark Center as well.

Since joining the Jade Dance Team, she found a love for the traditional Chinese dances and how it brings her a way to help the community to learn more about Chinese culture and art. She regularly practices with the team every week and enjoys meeting new members, dancing with her friends, and performing for the community. It has brought her happiness in spreading and celebrating Chinese culture. She is grateful for the opportunities it brings to learn more about Chinese culture and honor it with the community as well. She has performed with them at the Chinese Festival at Portland Pioneer Square, Lan Su Chinese Garden, Beaverton Theater, OCC Health Fair, PSUHKSA's Culture Show, and the Vancouver Chinese New Year Gala. Outside of volunteering, she enjoys playing piano, hiking, painting, playing tennis, and reading Chinese novels.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Claudia Zhuge.
