# Elise Yu - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 102**  

Elise is currently a junior at Lincoln High School. In her school community, she participates in and serve as vice president of the Red Cross Club. This involves organizing school-wide events such as blood drives and educational campaigns. In the past, she has also managed club logistics by sending weekly reminder emails and giving presentations. Being a part of the national Red Cross organization is especially rewarding because they are able to actively make a difference on a global scale. As a way to serve her local community, she is also a part of Mission: Citizen, a nonprofit organization offering free citizenship classes to help individuals prepare for the naturalization exam. To get involved, she has taught lessons online, and is now leading the communications department with tasks that involve managing the nonprofit's website & social media, and spreading the word about classes, scholarships, and general citizenship updates around the community. Using my interest in marketing and graphic design, she has helped promote and create content for various other student-led nonprofits as well.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Elise Yu.
