**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 120**  

Cherry is a sophomore at Lincoln High School. After watching her mother go through the challenging naturalization process, she knew she wanted to find a way to help others as they take on the citizenship test. Through her work with Mission: Citizen, she prepares future US citizens for the civics naturalization test. She hopes to encourage civic engagement in her students as they become effective citizens. By teaching live online classes every week, she educates students on American history, as well as on the rights and responsibilities that accompany US citizenship. Aside from this, she has also been helping to fight food insecurity with her involvement at Clay Street Table. As co-leader of Lincolnâ€™s FlockFeast service club, she serves Lincoln families in need by bagging up and delivering groceries to their front door. From these experiences, Cherry strives to continue her mission of improving the lives of others and making a positive impact on her community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Cherry Chen.
