In Monica's second year of receiving the President's Volunteer Service Award, she continued to cook at the church, brought more friends to help for Transition dinner and fed the homeless veterans. In addition to actively involving in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) competition by building the robot, she enjoys planning and leading fun outreach activities at local and international communities.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Monica Bao.
