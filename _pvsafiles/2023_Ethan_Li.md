# Ethan Li - Gold Award

**School: Union High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 338.5**  

Ethan Li is currently a senior at Union High School. Growing up in a family of restaurant owners, cooking was always something he had been exposed to and later on, developed an interest in. Ethan was motivated to provide support to individuals transitioning out of homelessness through cooking and serving food for the Transition Project shelter. In addition to his commitment to the Transition Project, Ethan actively participates in supporting Camp Meadowood Springs, a camp focused on aiding children with neurodivergence. Not only has he employed a bottle fundraiser to contribute to the cause, successfully amassing over $4700 through a dedicated bottle and can drive, he has also spent Memorial long weekend at the camp to work on renovations. Ethan's endeavors not only reflect his desire to give back to the community but also showcase his commitment to making a positive impact on the world.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ethan Li.
