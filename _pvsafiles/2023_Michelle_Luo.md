# Michelle Luo - Gold Award

**School: Sexton Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 77**  

Hello, I'm Michelle, a fourth-grade student at Sexton Mountain Elementary School. I practice rhythmic gymnastics and am also a member of the VEX IQ robotics team. In 2023, my team clinched the championship in the state of Oregon, earning us the opportunity to participate in the VEX Robotics World Championship. During the competition, I joined the volunteer team, spending several days collaborating with volunteers from around the world and learning a lot from their experiences. Additionally, I take part in various charity performance activities, eagerly sharing joy with others on stage. Over the summer break, my family and I volunteered together at the food bank, packaging and distributing food, in the hope that our efforts could provide more sustenance to those in need.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Michelle.
