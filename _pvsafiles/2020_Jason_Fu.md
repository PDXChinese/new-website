# Jason Fu - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 211**  

Jason Fu is a sophomore at Sunset High School. He participates in competitive badminton and is interested in software development. When the pandemic first arose, he grew increasingly concerned about the quality of the education the students were now receiving. After looking into it, he realized that students were beginning to fall behind due to the flaws of distance learning, so he began teaching numerous classes to resolve that. Under the YouthLink program, he taught Japanese, Python programming, and ELA, and is continuing to teach to this day. Additionally, after witnessing the misfortune of lower income communities, he realized that libraries are an effective way to treat this problem, so he began volunteering at his local library. To this day, Jason strives to aid those in need and improve the community for all.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jason Fu.
