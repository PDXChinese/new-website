In addition to her passion for STEM, Fiona is also invested in various art forms such as dance, music, and art.

Furthermore, Fiona is an executive director of the Beats of Bethany, a non-profit organization that focuses on bringing music to local senior centers. As an executive director, she helps organize and host performances throughout the year. With her passion for STEM and art, Fiona strives to continue spreading awareness and encouraging other young students to get involved.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Fiona Wang.
