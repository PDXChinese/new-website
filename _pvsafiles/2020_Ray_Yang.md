# Zixuan Ray Yang - Silver Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 80**  

Ray is a freshman at Westview Highschool, and loves working with kids of all age groups. He volunteered at his soccer club, where he would arrive an hour before practice to help coach the younger kids there. He gave the kids insights on how to become a better player while making strong bonds with them. Ray interacted with them by giving tips and answering their questions. Throughout the corona virus outbreak, Ray also became a teacher to kids who felt like they needed more help due to schools shutting down. He hosted online class sessions, where he taught Python and 4th grade ELA. Every week, he would meet with the kids, where Ray had classwork planned, and guide them through it. He encouraged the students to ask questions, so they could grasp the concepts completely. After every class, Ray sent the parents a summary of everything they did and what was assigned as homework. He helped the students create goals that they would aim to accomplish every week. He also created tiny quizzes to check in on their progress. While the students learned how to program and write, he learned how to be a better teacher. Rayâ€™s volunteering experience opened his eyes to the world around him, and he learned that everyone can make an impact on their community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ray Yang.
