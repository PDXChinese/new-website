# Zhi Qu - Gold Award

**School: Oregon Episcopal School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 115.5**  

I am a Freshman at Oregon Episcopal School. This year, I decided to spend my free time sharing my culture with the community around me. I enjoy learning about my culture and expressing myself through performances and guiding visitors in the Lansu Garden.

I have always been interested in this part of my identity. At the end of 8th grade, I joined the Phoenix Hanfu Team. We perform at festivals to display traditional Hanfu clothing. Seeing the awe in everyone's eyes during performances is worth the hours we spend practicing. Other than performing, I also hosted the Rising Stars performance. I am so glad to be a part of preserving and recreating art.

However, the community could only enjoy different arts if they have their needs met. I spend my weekends cooking Chinese cuisine for the Clark Center Shelter and cleaning kitchen appliances for a senior home. Each time, I leave with a lighter step, knowing their day would be easier from my work. "The pursuit of happiness" is a right everyone should have, but many don't have the resources to sustain themselves. I hope to provide some resources so that they can spend more time experiencing joy.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Zhi Qu.
