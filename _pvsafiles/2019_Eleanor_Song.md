# Eleanor Song - Bronze Award

**School: Stoller Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 50**  

Eleanor has had a fiery passion for reading since the time she memorized the lines of a picture book as a preschooler; *The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything* by Linda Williams engraved reading onto her heart and has stayed there since. This summer, twelve year old Eleanor decided to spend the free time that she had helping other children immerse themselves into this bright world of endless possibilities. Her local library runs an annual summer reading program that gives people a chance to volunteer to help their community and also a chance to begin reading for rewards. Eleanor had been signing up for summer reading since it was available to her, and always wondered as a younger child how the helpers behind the desk were offered such an opportunity. When given the option to volunteer there herself, she of course took it immediately, finalizing about fifty hours at the local library. The role was to help people sign up for the summer reading program, then, later in the summer, helping them receive rewards. The program included two people per two hour shifts, and volunteers could meet plenty of new people along the way. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Eleanor Song.
