# Erika Leung - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 125**  

Erika Leung is a sophomore at Lincoln High School. In her second year of receiving a President Volunteer Service Award, she has continued to advocate for civic engagement among students. Over the summer, she worked with Activate America to create comprehensive voting registration programs in targeted states. Through her work in data collection and social media outreach, she collaborated with schools to empower students to vote.

Over quarantine, Erika pursued her passion for environmental justice through her involvement in Sunrise Movement PDX, the Portland chapter of a national movement dedicated to stopping climate change. As Communications and Outreach Coordinator, Erika connected with community members and different organizations on a daily basis to create educational and empowering community events. Since then, she has localized her focus to her school. As co-president of the Environmental Justice Club, she organized a panel event of Portland youth activists with over 60 attendees to increase awareness and education of climate changeâ€™s impact on current and future generations. Erika emphasizes the importance of pursuing your passions through giving back to the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Erika Leung.
