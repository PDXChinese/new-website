# Fiona Zou - Gold Award

**School: Camas High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 256**  

Fiona is now a junior at Camas Highschool. She has a passionate interest in art and music. She co-founded a nonprofit organization called [Beats of Bethany](https://www.instagram.com/beatsofbethany/?hl=en) that seeks to support and empower youth who share the same passion for art and music to serve their community. Beats of Bethany hosts seasonal concerts at senior centers in the Oregon and Washington region and provides free art and music workshops to the underserved youth in low-income communities in the Portland metro area. Being able to work with students from economically challenged backgrounds has exposed Fiona to people from very different backgrounds and shed light on her privilege. Fiona cherishes her volunteering experiences because they allow her to help those who are less fortunate than her. This year, she expanded her involvement in volunteering and community service in her school community by being more involved in organizations at school, such as [Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/), [Link Crew](https://www.boomerangproject.com/link/what-is), and [Student Advisory Committee](https://www.camas.wednet.edu/about-csd/csd-at-a-glance/citizens-advisory-committee/), and pursuing her passion for tennis by managing the boy's tennis team. Her volunteering experiences have allowed her to grow and become more intuitive, passionate, and determined. Besides her dedication to volunteering, Fiona spends her time playing piano and tennis competitively. Fiona yearns to bring awareness to underprivileged youth and to connect people through music and art. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Fiona Zou.
