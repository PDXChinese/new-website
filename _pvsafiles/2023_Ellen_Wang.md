# Ellen Wang - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 209**  

Ellen is currently a freshman at Westview High School. Ever since she was young she has had a passion for music, performing for the non-profit organization of Beats of Bethany for various seasonal concerts. She has played piano for almost ten years and the chinese Guzheng for around four. Ellen enjoys playing soccer as well, as she played her first season on the JV team for Westview.

Ellen is also a cadet for the Washington County Sheriff's Office Search and Rescue team. This volunteer effort has made an impact on her life as she believes that it can truly benefit the community when needed and she would love to participate in more community services and events.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ellen Wang.
