# Ziyue (Yueyue) Wang - Silver Award

**School: International School of Beaverton**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 96**  

Volunteering for different organizations to help the community fills Yueyue with an inner energy very much like joy. Seeing the gratitude people have given her when helping them is the next best thing to love. It really is just a tragedy when she sees homeless people laying on the streets without any comfort or warmth. This chills her to the bones and she wants to help them to the best of her ability as a 13 year old girl.

She is currently attending 8th grade in the International School of Beaverton, the number one high school in Oregon and the second best middle school in Oregon. She has done countless community service hours for both the Oregon Chinese Coalition and other organizations. Many of the volunteering she has done in the Oregon Chinese Coalition has been centered at Chinatown inside the heart of Portland.

Some volunteering activities she has participated in are [hanging up lanterns at Chinatown](https://pdxchinese.org/chinatown/newyear/2020-09-20-chinatown_lantern_2020/), [repainting the walls of the historic building](https://pdxchinese.org/chinatown/wonglaundry/2022-01-23-repainting_wong_laundry_2022/), [helping with vaccine boosters](https://pdxchinese.org/vaccination_clinic_lecare/), distributing food to senior citizens, collecting bottles for Camp Meadowood, volunteering to [host a crafts table at Chinese Festival](https://pdxchinese.org/chinese-festival-2022/) in Pioneer Courthouse square, and wrapping gifts at Elk Lodge.

Other non - Oregon Chinese Coalition volunteering hours she has done are helping box food at the food bank, cooking food at hospitals to feed the patients, and collecting groceries for senior citizens who donâ€™t have the ability to purchase these items themselves.

She has done many of the same volunteering organizations countless times because she finds happiness in helping others. This is her experience as a teenager helping their community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ziyue Wang.
