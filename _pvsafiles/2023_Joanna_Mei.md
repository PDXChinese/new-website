# Joanna Mei - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 182**  

Joanna, a junior at Sunset High School, enjoys giving back to the community and spreading awareness about STEM. Believing that volunteering can improve our community, Joanna has collected over 1,000 bottles from the neighborhood, and donated the money to the local Ukraine community through her FTC robotics team. Additionally, she has worked hard at volunteering for the local food bank and cooked food at the Bethany Presbyterian Church for the homeless veterans in the Doreenâ€™s place, a part of the transition project.

Joanna is also extremely passionate about Engineering and Science, leading her to teach fifth graders through hands-on activities about different concepts in Chemistry and Physics. Additionally, Joanna is a part of an FTC team and has taught Ukraine children and those with less exposure to STEM about STEM and engineering. Through the team, she has also volunteered for other robotics competitions such as FLL, provided consultation to FLL teams and volunteered to stream the competitions, providing a platform for others to watch. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Joanna Mei.
