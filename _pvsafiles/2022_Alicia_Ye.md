# Alicia Ye - Gold Award

**School: Groton School in Massachusetts**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 102**  

Alicia is a sophomore at Groton School in Massachusetts. Ever since she was little, she enjoyed learning about STEM, and received kindness and support from the community around her to further this passion. Over the summer of 2022, she volunteered at Engineering for Kids Portland, where she helped younger students through engineering and design projects, helping to develop their STEM passions at a young age.

Prior to Groton School, Alicia attended Catlin Gabel School in Portland, Oregon, where she was part of the Palma Scholars Program. Students from this program went on a trip to Utah and Arizona. Here, she volunteered at the Best Friends Animal Shelter, and Cherish Families, opening her eyes to diverse volunteer opportunities in a different location.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Alicia Ye.
