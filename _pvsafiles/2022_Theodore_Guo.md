# Theodore Guo - Gold Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 168**  

Theodore is currently a junior at Jesuit High School and also the team captain of [FTC12808 RevAmped Robotics](https://revampedrobotics.org/). Over the course of the year, I've done a lot of volunteer activities within our robotics team as well as with Jesuit High School.

Theodore has done a total of 168 hours over the course of the time eligible for the award, and he is proud to be part of Oregon's Chinese culture and would like to continue to do volunteer work and contribute to our community in the future.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Theodore Guo.
