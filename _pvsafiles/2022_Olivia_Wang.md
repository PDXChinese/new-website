# Olivia Wang - Silver Award

**School: West Linn High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 76**  

Olivia is a Freshman at West Linn High School. She’s always been interested in expressing her creativity, leading her to start volunteering at the [Tualatin Library’s MakerSpace Lab](https://www.tualatinoregon.gov/library/makerspace-open-lab-21), helping people of all ages explore an area where they can express their creativity and imagination, whether it’s through painting with watercolors, coding with robots, or creating models with the 3-D printer.

During the summer of 2021, Olivia participated in [Tualatin Library Summer Teen Program](https://www.tualatinoregon.gov/volunteer/library-summer-teens-2023), volunteering in various activities the library ran during the summer, such as MakerSpace Labs, Summer Reading Program, and the monthly Spruce up for the library. She successfully completed over 20 volunteer hours throughout the summer.

Olivia is a current member of [Tualatin Library’s TLC Teen Library Committee](https://www.tualatinoregon.gov/library/teen-library-committee), to help plan events and make decisions as a representative for teens in the community. The Teen Library Committee wants to encourage teens to come to the library and make the library a suitable place for teens and others of all ages.

Olivia hopes to participate in more library volunteering opportunities in the future. She hopes her volunteering helps make a contribution towards the community, and would love to explore more volunteering opportunities outside of the library.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Olivia Wang.
