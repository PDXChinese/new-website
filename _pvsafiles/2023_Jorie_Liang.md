# Jorie Liang - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 264**  

My name is Jorie Liang and I am a sophomore at Catlin Gabel School. In my volunteer work, I combine my passions of fashion and dancing with serving the greater community. I am one of the co-founders of Vision Envoy club branch of the Lake Oswego Lions Club. I also dance with OCC's Jade Dance Team, volunteer with the Chinese Youth and Women Development organization, and work as a team leader in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's Student Visionaries of the Year 2023-24 campaign. The majority of my work is connected to representing Asian culture in the media through different performing art forms.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jorie Liang.
