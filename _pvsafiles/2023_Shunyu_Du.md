# Shunyun (Kevin) Du - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 101.1**  

My name is Kevin Du and I am a sophomore at Westview High School. I am extremely passionate about Fencing, Music, and Cybersecurity. This year I have helped teach the community about cybersecurity basics through Tech Caregiver events. I have also been fencing for 7 years and am a Referee for USA Fencing. I wanted to spread my fencing experience around the world so when I went to China this summer, I helped out with the local youth fencing classes. I am also the Co-Founder of Beats of Bethany. Beats of Bethany is a non-profit organization that empowers youths to support their community. Beats of Bethany hosts seasonal concerts at senior homes in both the Oregon and Washington districts. Beats of Bethany has allowed me to share my passion for music with the world.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Shunyu Du.
