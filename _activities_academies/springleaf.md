Springleaf Chinese School was founded by a group of Chinese parents in March 1997. It is currently housed in the Sylvania Campus, Portland   Community College. It is open on Saturdays. More than 100 students from the Portland Metropolitan area are at present enrolled in the school.

Nine levels of Chinese language and art classes are offered in the school. The school principal selected by the Board of Directors directs and coordinates all major activities. The Board of Directors supports the Principal and sets school policies. Teachers of the school are responsible for weekly teaching activities and some of the school logistics. Only teachers of the school are given a nominal honorarium for their committed time every week. The principal and other board members are volunteers.

The major goal of the school is to create an environment for students to:

Obtain proficiency in Chinese language, spoken as well as written, and
Learn to appreciate art through hands-on experience.

Springleaf Chinese School admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to the students at the school.
