Effective Chinese is a unique program that evolved through a collaboration among several Chinese teachers, an American software developer and lots of students.

Our goal is to make Mandarin more accessible to adult learners. And we follow three simple principles.

Engage students in relevant classroom activities.
Keep them engaged with compelling online activities.
Use language that resonates with Chinese people

The school continues to evolve with changing technology, a widening circle of teachers and increased diversity among students.
