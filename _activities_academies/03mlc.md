Steve Riehle, born in 1980, is the founder of the Mandarin Learning Center in Beaverton, Oregon. At the age of 13, Steve expressed a profound interest in Mandarin and in his late teenage years traveled abroad to learn the language. Once he returned to the United States he continued to educate and assist students with learning the Chinese language. His books and school curriculum are a testimony to his determinism toward helping others learn this fun language.
