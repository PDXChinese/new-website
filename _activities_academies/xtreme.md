XSTREAM Learning Center provides an after-school program and additional classes centered on the subjects of Cross-Cultural Communication, Science, Technology, Reading and Writing, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. We believe this curriculum is the key to becoming a contributing member of the high-tech highly-connected society of the future.

Our mission is to foster and build upon childrenâ€™s natural curiosity about the world around them and how it works by giving them ample opportunity to explore a wide variety of subjects, finding what interests them, and expanding that into new directions.

We welcome and embrace all students and their families, regardless of gender, race, color, national and ethnic origin. XSTREAM Learning Center is for all families who want their children to be cared for in a warm, nurturing, positive environment that is focused on everyone coming together to improve themselves and by extension the group as a whole.
