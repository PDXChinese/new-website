"Located in the Alberta Arts District, Laundry is Portland’s original vintage teamwear store. Featuring the city’s best selection of snapbacks and jerseys, Laundry was hailed by Willamette Week as “the most original vintage shop Portland has seen in years.”

Laundry is host to special events and activations, and has worked with the Portland Trail Blazers, adidas, and CarMax, among other brands. Clothing from Laundry has appeared on LeBron James, Odell Beckham Jr., and many other nice people."
