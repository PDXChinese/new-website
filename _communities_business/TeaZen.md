"Immersive tea tasting in our little tea house, featuring different tabletop flower arrangements and aromatherapy every week!.
There will be Chinese style tea art demonstrations and on certain holidays Guzheng ( Chinese musical instrument) performances.

Guests will choose between black tea, oolong tea, yellow tea, green tea, dark tea and scented teas from China at different tea tasting times.
I have been in touch with tea since I was 10 years of age and it has always been a part of my life.

In China I worked as a landscape designer, and also became an enthusiastic tea master.

After I moved to America, my partner and husband Joseph singlehandedly built the tea house for me, according to my design. Everything including the slab table was made by Joseph over a period of two years.

Now I would like to share with others this tea house full of love energy and my love of Chinese tea, the etiquette of drinking tea and interesting stories of China.

This place is perfect for a romantic getaway or wedding or baby shower, and a myriad of other events.

NOTE FROM HUSBAND JOE: I personally built this tea house for my Chinese wife, just for her to maintain the habit of drinking tea."
