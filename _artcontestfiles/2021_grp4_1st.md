## Message

My inspiration is human beings live in harmony with nature, nature brings me happiness, because our family loves to go to wildlife refuge nature parks when we have time, we love spend a whole day to explore and make lots of observation over there. Telescope is the most important equipment that we must bring together, we can use it to easily watch the animal's activity, such as grey heron, turtle, frog, duck, deer, birds, and squirrel in the park, so I draw them all in my paper, and I also recorded some ladybug, ants, snail, dragonfly, butterfly, trees, grasses and mushroom. Lake is the important part for those area, it helps nature with a good ecological balance. Human is the member of the nature, we are grateful for the happiness that nature brings to us, we also respect and treat well to our natural environment so that we can continue to coexist well.
