## Message

The Sandhill Crane is a species of Crane native to Oregon. They are often seen in large groups, and you can hear their occasional, but unique rolling cries. They live in habitat marshes spread across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. This painting uses acrylic paints and features one Sandhill Crane resting in the marshes of a farm, while another one is flying in the distance.  I drew this painting to show the natural beauty of wildlife coexisting with humans. I hope that this will encourage the conservation of wildlife and improve the bond between humans and natural wildlife.
