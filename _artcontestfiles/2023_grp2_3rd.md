## Message

During late summer, I often go to the backyard area, where my mom has planted various types of flowers, fruits, and vegetables. It's a really beautiful sight when all the plants are flourishing, especially as it nears harvest time. The satisfaction of growing and gathering our own plants is rewarding in a special, healing sort of way, which is why I chose to portray myself working within the greenery. This painting depicts me as I garden, surrounded by colorful foliage and pleased with a good yield of crops.
