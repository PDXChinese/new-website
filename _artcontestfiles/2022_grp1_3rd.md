## Message

Iâ€™ve always been a shy, introverted person. When the pandemic hit a couple years ago and everyone was forced into lockdown, it was at first a relief. It felt like I could finally relax. However, I soon found myself getting bored.

I learned about the benefits of meditation and started meditating outdoors. Although human connection was limited, I began to feel strangely connected to the trees, the grass, the flowers, like I had become part of the landscape. We were all formed from the same matter that had come from the death throes of a star, had taken different evolutionary paths, but still shared a common ancestor.

I created this piece as a result of my reflections, to show that all life is connected, and that we need to do our part to protect it, as much for others as for ourselves.
