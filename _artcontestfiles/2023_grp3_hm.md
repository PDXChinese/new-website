## Message

I drew this piece to represent harmony and peace in nature. In my drawing, by the shoreline of the lake, there is a tent, and so also humans. But there is no fire that could lose control or weapons that could hurt. I want this to show people that we can exist alongside wild plants and animals without one hurting the other.
