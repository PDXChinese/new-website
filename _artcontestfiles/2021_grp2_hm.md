## Message

When we learn about wildlife, it's about the endangered species, the penguins of Antarctica, or the poison dart frogs of the Amazon rainforest. But what we're blinded from is the fact that wildlife exists all around us, even in our communities- the trees in our neighborhood, deer who roam behind the bushes, or even the chipmunks who scurry beneath the logs. When I notice the abundance of wildlife around me, I can't help but be grateful to live in such a wonderful community, because it's not just the big things that count; every small detail, every plant, every animal makes our home a safer and livelier place. Supporting wildlife isn't just about showing that you care for important causes, it's also about showing your love and appreciation for the little things that make life special.
