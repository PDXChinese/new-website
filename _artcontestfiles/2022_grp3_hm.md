## Message

I enjoy hiking with my family if we have time. This picture shows the beauty of the nature I have seen in my hikes. This picture also shows my love for animals, We have seen many amazing animals in the wild, including the bird in my drawing. Birds were one of my favorite animals since I was a young Child. I would admire their grace as they glided through the air. Sadly I never was able to fly with birds. But I was able to admire them from up close on rare occasions. The picture shows the moment where I was able to admire a tree swallow closely while hiking. In the end, I was still able to admire nature up close.
