## Message

Koi fish have been my favorite species of fish ever since I saw them at a pond in a Japanese garden. I was drawn to their mesmerizing patterns and soothing presence. I remember seeing my reflection as I watched their fluid movements and vibrant colors as they gracefully glided through the water. This memory of mine inspired my entry, which shows me looking at my reflection as koi fish surround it.
