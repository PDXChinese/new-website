## Message

I love to explore nature parks, often spending whole days walking around and observing the birds, wild animals, and flowers.  My favorite thing to do is blow wild dandelions into the air and watch as they drift away. Being surrounded by nature makes me feel so peaceful and "at home". As part of nature, I feel that we need to live in harmony with wildlife and nature. We should not only enjoy, but also treasure and respect nature!
