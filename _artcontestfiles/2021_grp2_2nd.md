## Message

I was inspired by Oregon's water-abundant landscapes and wildlife, especially birds. Common local birds such as mallard ducks, red-breasted nuthatches, and Anna's hummingbirds are included in the painting. During quarantine, I couldn't go far outside so I developed an interest in observing birds from my backyard. This painting is a manifestation of my relationship with local nature.
