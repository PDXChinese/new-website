For this artwork, oil pastels were used to draw the sky and mountains. Crayon was used to draw the trees, along with the reflections in the water. The lake was drawn with colored pencils, so were the grass and animals.  

**Group Level: Grade 4-6**

## Message

Oregon has a lot of beautiful scenery and views, but I don't get out to see them very often. I dreamed of having a wooden cabin in a landscape, on the grass, being able to play and interact with unique animals. I am worried that environmental pollution and excessive hunting will affect these lovely scenery, and I will not be able to see these beautiful sights in the future. I'm doing my part to keep the environment clean and the animals safe, and hope that others also help to protect.
