## Message

This is our backyard in the summer, and it is a beautiful place. Dad and I grew a lot of colorful flowers. I liked my brother’s flower box the best. Squirrels and bees came to play with our flowers. The spider climbed down to eat bugs caught on their web. The birds came to eat the sunflower seeds. We caught a caterpillar and put it in the box and fed it lettuce. I would like to have an owl visit me sometime.
