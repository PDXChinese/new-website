## Message

I go out on walks and nature outings often, and every time, there is vivid wildlife anywhere I look. Although it is easy to focus on yourself, being curious and observing your surroundings presents many beautiful sights from nature. In my art, I show myself on a lakeside observing the various animals that inhabit it.
