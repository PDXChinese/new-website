## Message

I wanted to place the deer is in front of Mt. Hood as I think it really represents the habitat of the deer and how it lives. I love seeing the deer is in the summer season with the summer flowers blooming in forests all over Mt. Hood. I think it shows all the nature and wildlife that lives here in Oregon, but also the beauty of what grows here in the summer.
