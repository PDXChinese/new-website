## Message

Every year I go to the Portland Rose Garden with my family. This painting is of a photo of me at the garden, admiring the flowers. Although the rose garden gets busy during the summer months, it still feels peaceful when standing amongst the rose bushes. Visiting the rose garden is my favorite way to connect with nature, because I can observe nature's beauty and diversity.
