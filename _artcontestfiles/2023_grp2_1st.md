## Message

I’ve always held a close connection with nature, and I don’t think nature should be destroyed by humans. Although species can go extinct, nature is not merely plants and animals living in random habitats. Nature is a full circle of plants and wildlife that thrive on various native habitats. Native habitats are essential for conservation of biodiversity and beauty of nature for humans to appreciate and explore. I was inspired to create this drawing after visiting Tualatin River Wildlife Refuge and experiencing the efforts made to rebuild and conserve nature. This art depicts the reality that I saw when I was planting native grasses at the refuge, and in contrast, my perspective as shown by my hand drawing a mental image of me envisioning wet meadow prairies with native plants and wildlife (from popcorn flowers and Nelson's checkermallows to western pond turtles), a thriving land that can be restored after just a bit of effort from us.
