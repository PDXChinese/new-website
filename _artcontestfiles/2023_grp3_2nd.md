## Message

Last summer, my parents introduced me to paddle-boarding and I really enjoyed it. I loved watching the sunset with my dad while my sisters blew dandelions on the shore with my mom. I always felt satisfied and happy after paddle-boarding. My parents told me that was the superpower of nature. It cures you when you are not well in a quiet and magical way.
