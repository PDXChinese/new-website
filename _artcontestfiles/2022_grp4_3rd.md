## Message

I have always wanted to have a hammock under a big tree that I can lay in on hot summer days. I think seals are cute, their eyes are very pretty. We are going on an Alaska cruise very soon and I am excited to see all the sea and land animals. I am hoping to see black bears, eagles and whales. Once we found a jelly fish on the beach, and my mom rescued it by putting it back in the ocean.
