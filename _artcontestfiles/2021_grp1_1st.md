## Message

During quarantine, I faced a lot of stress and burnout as I overloaded myself with work as a distraction from the world around me. It was when I decided to go on daily nature walks with my family that I was able to gradually bring myself back to reality. We would go out on trails and sketch whatever we saw. From monarch butterflies to red columbines to wapato plants, I grew my love for the native Oregon flora and fauna and in return, my creativity reignited. I emerged from my shell and began painting again, as represented in the pink brushstrokes, and I'm forever thankful for that.
