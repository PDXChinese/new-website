“A Squirrel Boy In The Fantastic Forest!”

I enjoy reading and going hiking and camping, to explore nature. I love to search for small and big animals, and plants in a forest, or in a park. I imagine myself sitting on a huge green tree with a family of squirrels. I join their family table. We are eating acorns as snack! We see all kinds of animals and plants around us. The hungry coyote and the big red fox are looking for tasty food to eat. Wood ducks are swimming, while the great blue heron is trying to catch yummy fish. Bald eagles, butterflies, dragonflies, and crows fly through the lovely, blue sky. Deer walk, snakes slither, owls “hoot!”, while racoons, ladybugs, and spiders climb. Can you find all these animals in my painting? This is the wonderful nature I love!
