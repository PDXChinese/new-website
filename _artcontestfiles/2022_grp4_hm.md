## Message

Flowers are pretty and I can find them everywhere. They are in the park, in our backyard, at school; they are even in my head. I love rainbows too. I can see them from the window by my study desk after it rains. In our backyard, we have flower pots and water buckets. Underneath them, I can find lots of worms. I like to bring them to our compost pile where there is lots of yummy food for them to eat and become huge. My brother and I like to see who can find the biggest worm in the spring.
