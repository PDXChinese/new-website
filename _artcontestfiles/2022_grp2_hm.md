## Message

I enjoy going on daily walks outside, which allow me to admire the nature in my neighborhood. I was inspired by my walks and the native wildlife, such as squirrels, deer, and coyotes, so I decided to draw an animal that lives in Oregon. I chose the Pacific fishers; a lesser known animal in Oregon, and one that deserves more attention.
