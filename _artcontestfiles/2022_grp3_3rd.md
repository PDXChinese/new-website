## Message

You can watch nature but, you can’t harm it. Trees and animals have a mind of their own. I drew a bird, squirrels, a black-tailed deer, a skunk, a snake and many more. It represents that  animals can take care of themselves, and if you interfere with wildlife, you could hurt the animals so they can’t take care of themselves anymore. I drew my dog and I in my drawing to show how we are a part of nature but only as observers. We are only watching the other animals, we are not physically touching any of them.
